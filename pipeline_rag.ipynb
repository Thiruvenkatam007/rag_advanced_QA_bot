It includes both general data collection conventions and item-specific guidance, \\nas well as links to resources for agencies. \\n\\n1.2 Organization of the Manual \\nThis manual includes the following content: \\n\\n•  Chapter 1 – Introduction to the OASIS Manual, including the manual purpose, structure and content, and \\n\\ndescription of the OASIS requirements and conventions. The manual summarizes the statutory authority for \\nOASIS data collection, and describes the background on the development of OASIS, and its version history. \\n\\n•  Chapter 2 – The importance of Data Accuracy, and how HHAs may audit OASIS data to minimize errors. \\n\\nThis chapter briefly describes OASIS data correction and implications for reporting. \\n\\n•  Chapter 3 – Item-specific guidance, subdivided into sections. \\n\\n•  Appendix A – Glossary and Common Acronyms \\n\\n•  Appendix B – OASIS Items, Time Points and Uses \\n\\n•  Appendix C – OASIS Instruments (All Items, and all Time Points versions) \\n\\n•  Appendix D – Description of Changes from OASIS-E to OASIS-E1 \\n\\n•  Appendix E – References and Resources \\n\\n•  Appendix F – OASIS and Quality Improvement'),\n",
