If no Stage 2 pressure ulcers are observed, enter \u201c0\u201d in A1, and skip A2. If at least\none Stage 2 pressure ulcer is observed and reported in A1, enter in A2 the number of these Stage 2\npressure ulcers that were observed at the same stage at the most recent SOC/ROC.\n\n\u2022 Dash is a valid response for this item at the discharge time point.\n\no A dash indicates \u201cno information.\u201d CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence.\n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022 Any type of flap procedure performed to surgically replace a pressure ulcer is reported as a surgical wound,\n\nuntil healed. It should not be reported as a pressure ulcer/injury on M1311.\n\n\u2022 A pressure ulcer treated with any type of graft is no longer reported as a pressure ulcer/injury, and until\n\nhealed, should be reported as a surgical wound on M1340.\n\n\u2022 A pressure ulcer that has been surgically debrided remains a pressure ulcer and should not be reported as a\n\nsurgical wound on M1340.\n\nExamples - Identify \u201cPresent at the most recent SOC/ROC\u201d to answer M1311 at Discharge \n\n1. Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) with intact skin at a SOC assessment becomes numerically stageable The RN\n\nassesses a patient\u2019s skin at the SOC and identifies a DTI with intact skin on the patient\u2019s left heel. This DTI\nremains unchanged until the RN skin assessment 10 days later, which reveals open skin presenting as a Stage 3\npressure ulcer. The pressure ulcer does not change for the remainder of the episode. At the discharge skin\nassessment, the ulcer remains a Stage 3. (In this example, there are no other pressure ulcers/injuries at the SOC\nassessment, during the episode or at discharge).", "type": "Document"}}
