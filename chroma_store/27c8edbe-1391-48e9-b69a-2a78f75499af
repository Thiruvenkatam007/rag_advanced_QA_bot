OASIS data \nare used for multiple purposes, including production of quality reports for agencies, public reports on the Care \nCompare website, and to determine payment. Thus, it is imperative that the OASIS data that HHAs collect and \nsubmit be accurate and complete. Regulatory language specifying accuracy of OASIS data can be found in the \nMedicare Conditions of Participation Accuracy of Encoded OASIS Data found in Section 484.55 of the \nConditions of Participation (See Appendix E). This language stipulates that the encoded OASIS data must \naccurately reflect the patient\u2019s status at the time the information is collected. The State survey process for HHAs \nmay include review of OASIS data collected versus data encoded and transmitted to the CMS. \n\n2.2 Data Auditing \nIt follows that minimizing data errors that could affect accuracy of clinical data or outcome analyses is a \nnecessary condition. This is the responsibility of the agency since, ultimately, agency-level quality reports reflect \nthe data agencies input into the system. Internal staff development and training should focus on data accuracy, \nnot only at the start-up of OASIS data collection, but on a continuing basis.
