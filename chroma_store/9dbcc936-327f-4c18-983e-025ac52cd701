A nurse\u2019s note describes a patient who climbed over their bedrail and fell to the floor. On examination, they \nhad a cut over their left eye and some swelling on their arm. The patient was sent to the emergency room, \nwhere x-rays revealed no injury and neurological checks revealed no changes in mental status. The patient \nreturned home within 24 hours. \no  Coding: J1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 1, One. \no  Rationale: Lacerations and swelling without fracture are classified as injury (except major). \n3.  A patient fell, lacerated their head, and was sent to the emergency room, where a head computerized \n\ntomography (CT) scan revealed a subdural hematoma. The patient received treatment and returned home after \n2 days. \no  Coding: J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 1, One. \no  Rationale: Subdural hematoma is a major injury, and it occurred as a result of the fall. \n\n4.  Review of the patient record, incident reports and patient and caregiver report identify that two falls occurred \nsince the most recent SOC/ROC. The falls are documented in clinical notes. The first describes an event \nduring which the patient tripped on the bathroom rug and almost fell but caught themself against the sink. The \nRN assessment identified no injury. The second describes an event during which the patient, while coming up \nthe basement stairs with the laundry, fell against the stairs and sustained a bruise and laceration on their left \nknee. \no  Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 1, one non-injurious fall since the most recent SOC/ROC. \nJ1900B, Injury (except major), would be coded 1, one injurious (except major) fall since the most recent \nSOC/ROC. J1900C, Major injury, would be coded 0, no falls with major injury since the most recent \nSOC/ROC.", "type": "Document"}}
