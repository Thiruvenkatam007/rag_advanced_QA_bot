A bowel ostomy being \nallowed to close on its own is excluded as a surgical wound. \n\n\u2022  All other ostomies are excluded from consideration under this item and should not be counted as surgical \n\nwounds. \no  There are many types of \"ostomies,\" all of which involve a surgically formed opening from outside the \n\nbody to an internal organ or cavity. Examples include cystostomy, urostomy, thoracostomy, tracheostomy, \ngastrostomy, etc. \n\n\u2022  Other examples of surgical wounds include, but are not limited to: \n\no  Orthopedic pin sites, \no  Central line sites (centrally inserted venous catheters), \no  Wounds with drains, \no  Medi-port sites and other implanted infusion devices, or \no  Venous access devices \n\n\u2022  A PICC line (peripherally inserted venous catheter), either tunneled or non-tunneled, is NOT a surgical \n\nwound, when it is peripherally inserted. \n\n\u2022  Cataract surgery of the eye, surgery to the mucosal membranes, or a gynecological surgical procedure via a \n\nvaginal approach do NOT create a surgical wound for the purpose of this item. \n\nM1342: Status of Most Problematic Surgical Wound that is Observable \n\nItem Intent \n\nIdentifies the degree of healing present in the most problematic, observable surgical wound. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care  \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of surgical wounds. \nPatient/caregiver report, medical records, including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be \nused. \n\n\u2022  Determine which surgical wounds (as defined in M1340 guidance) are observable. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIdentify the most problematic observable surgical wound.", "type": "Document"}}
