Therefore, the denominator is every patient in the reporting period that is not excluded from the measure. \nIn the \u201cImprovement in Dyspnea\u201d quality measure, the denominator is the number of home health quality episodes \nending with a discharge during the reporting period, other than those covered by generic or measure-specific \nexclusions. (Remember that for the \u201cImprovement in Dyspnea\u201d quality measure, home health quality episodes for \nwhich the patient, at start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, are excluded from this quality \nmeasure as are quality episodes that end in transfer to an inpatient facility, death, or discharge to a non-\ninstitutional/home hospice.) \n\nSample Agency Calculation: If an agency had 100 patients during the reporting period that were discharged from \nthe agency, and 10 of these patients scored \u201c0\u201d at start of care/resumption of care on M1400 (and therefore were \nexcluded) and 70 of the remaining 90 patients improved in dyspnea (moved from a higher numeric score on \nM1400 to a lower numeric score), then 70/90 (or 0.777) which equals 77.77% scored favorably or improved in \ndyspnea. \n\nFor a high-level overview of how data elements are used within CMS assessment instruments to construct quality \nmeasures, refer to training resources at the Home Health Quality Reporting Training webpage at \nhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-\nInstruments/HomeHealthQualityInits/Home-Health-Quality-Reporting-Training.  \n\nMEASURING STABILIZATION \n\nIn our example, we noted that with improvement in OASIS-based quality measures, the patient\u2019s status moved \nfrom a higher numeric score (at start of care or resumption of care) on the OASIS response scale to a lower \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n276\n\fAppendix F", "type": "Document"}}
