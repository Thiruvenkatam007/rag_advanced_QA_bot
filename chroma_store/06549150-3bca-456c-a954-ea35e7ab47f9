If the patient is unable to decide between 2 options, then the assessing clinician should code for the \noption with the higher frequency. \n\n\u2022  The key difference between code 0, Does not apply and code 1, Rarely or not at all is that for code 0, the \npatient reports no pain/hurting in the past 5 days, and code 1, the patient reports pain/hurting HAS been \npresent in the past 5 days, but has rarely or not at all impacted sleep. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the patient reports they had pain in the past 5 days and the pain does not interfere with the patient\u2019s sleep \n(e.g., because the patient is using pain management strategies successfully), code 1, Rarely or not at all. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  Assessing clinician: \u201cOver the past 5 days, how much of the time has pain made it hard for you to sleep at \n\nnight?\u201d \n\nPatient: \u201cI\u2019ve had a little back pain from being in the wheelchair all day, but it\u2019s felt so much better when I \ngo to bed. The pain hasn\u2019t kept me from sleeping at all.\u201d \no  Coding: J0510 would be coded 1, Rarely or not at all. \no  Rationale: The patient reports pain has been present, but no sleep problems related to pain. \n\n2.
