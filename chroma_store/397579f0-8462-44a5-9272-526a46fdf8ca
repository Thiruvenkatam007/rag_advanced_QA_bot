OASIS is not intended \nto represent a comprehensive assessment in and of itself. HHAs are expected to incorporate OASIS items into \ntheir comprehensive assessment documentation and follow their own assessment policies and procedures. \nAgencies may rearrange OASIS item sequence in a way that permits logical ordering within their own forms and \nelectronic records, if the actual item content, and OASIS number and formatting remain the same, and \nmaintaining the same skip logic. The comprehensive assessment forms the basis of the physician-ordered Plan of \nCare. Thus, there should be congruence between the overall comprehensive assessment and the Plan of Care. \n\nAgencies may have the comprehensive assessment including OASIS, if applicable, completed by one clinician. \nIf collaboration with other health care personnel and/or agency staff is utilized, the agency is responsible for \nestablishing policies and practices related to collaborative efforts, including how assessment information from \nmultiple clinicians will be documented within the clinical record, ensuring compliance with applicable \nrequirements, and accepted standards of practice. \n\n1.5.3 When is OASIS Completed?
