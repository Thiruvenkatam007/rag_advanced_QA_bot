In 2020, persons \n\naged 65 years or older accounted for 81% of United States (U.S.) COVID-19 related deaths.   \n\n\u2022  Severe illness caused by COVID-19 means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, \n\nintensive care, ventilator support for breathing, or may even die. \n\n\u2022  A strong infection prevention and control (IPC) program is vital to protect both patients and healthcare \n\npersonnel (HCP). \n\n\u2022  Remaining up to date with all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses is critical to protect both staff and \n\npatients from SARS-CoV-2 infection.   \n\n\u2022  COVID-19 vaccines currently approved or authorized by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) are \n\neffective in reducing the risk of serious outcomes of COVID-19, including severe disease, hospitalization, and \ndeath. \n\n\u2022  Efforts to increase the number of people in the United States who are up to date with their COVID-19 \n\nvaccines remain an important strategy to preventing illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID-19. \n\n\u2022  A vaccine, like any other medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.  \nSerious problems from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are very rare.  More information about potential side effects of \nthe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, precautions and contraindications can be found on the CDC webpage \u201cInterim \nClinical Considerations for Use of COVID-19 Vaccines in the United States\u201d at \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-\nus.html#contraindications.  \n\nTime Point(s) Item Completed", "type": "Document"}}
