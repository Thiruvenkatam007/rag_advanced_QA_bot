For example, if the words are repeated back in a \n\nsentence, they would be counted as repeating the words. \n\n\u2022  Do not score the number of repeated words on the second or third attempt. These attempts help with learning \nthe item, but only the number correct on the first attempt goes into the total score. Do not record the number \nof attempts that the patient needed to complete. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The assessing clinician says, \u201cThe words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\u201d The \npatient replies, \u201cBed, sock, and blue.\u201d The clinician repeats the three words with category cues, by saying, \n\u201cThat\u2019s right, the words are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture.\u201d \no  Coding: C0200 Repetition of Three Words would be coded 3, Three words correct. \no  Rationale: The patient repeated all three items on the first attempt. The order of repetition does not affect \nthe score. Per the Response Specific Instructions, the assessing clinician repeats the words with the \ncategory cues after the patient correctly states all three words. \n\n2.  The assessing clinician says, \u201cThe words are sock, blue, and bed. Now please tell me the three words.\u201d The \npatient replies, \u201cSock, bed, black.\u201d The clinician repeats the three words plus the category cues, saying, \u201cLet \nme say the three words again. They are sock, something to wear; blue, a color; and bed, a piece of furniture. \nNow tell me the three words.\u201d The patient says, \u201cOh yes, that\u2019s right, sock, blue, bed.\u201d \no  Coding: C0200 Repetition of Three Words would be coded 2; Two of three words correct. \no  Rationale: The patient repeated two of the three items on the first attempt. Patients are scored based on \n\nthe first attempt.", "type": "Document"}}
