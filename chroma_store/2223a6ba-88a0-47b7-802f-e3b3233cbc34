The items identify \nthe patient\u2019s ABILITY, not necessarily actual performance. \u201cWillingness\u201d and \u201cadherence\u201d are not the focus of \nthese items. The patient must be viewed from a holistic perspective in assessing ability to perform ADLs. Ability \ncan be temporarily or permanently limited by: \n\n\u2022  physical impairments (for example, limited range of motion, impaired balance) \n\n\u2022  emotional/cognitive/behavioral impairments (for example, memory deficits, impaired judgment, fear) \n\n\u2022  sensory impairments, (for example, impaired vision or pain) \n\n\u2022  environmental barriers. \n\nM1800: Grooming \n\nItem Intent \n\nIdentifies the patient\u2019s ability to tend to personal hygiene needs, excluding bathing, shampooing hair, and toileting \nhygiene. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care \n\n\u2022  Follow-up \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  Observation/demonstration is the preferred method for coding this item. \n\n\u2022  The assessing clinician may also interview the patient and/or caregiver, conduct environmental assessment \n\nand may consider available input from other agency staff who have had direct patient contact. \n\n\u2022  The patient\u2019s ability may change as the patient\u2019s condition improves or declines, as medical restrictions are \n\nimposed or lifted, or as the environment is modified. The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do \non the day of the assessment. If ability varies over time, choose the response describing the patient\u2019s ability \nmore than 50% of the time period under consideration.", "type": "Document"}}
