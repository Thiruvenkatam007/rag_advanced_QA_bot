For example, over time, even though a Stage 4 pressure ulcer \nhas been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the tissues that were lost (muscle, \nfat, dermis) will never be replaced with the same type of tissue. Unless it becomes unstageable, clinical \nstandards require that a Stage 4 pressure ulcer continue to be documented as a Stage 4 pressure ulcer until it \nhas healed. \no  If a pressure ulcer is Stage 4 at SOC and is granulating at the next assessment, the ulcer remains a Stage 4 \n\nulcer. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n201\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection M: Skin Conditions \n\nM1330: Does this patient have a Stasis Ulcer? \n\nItem Intent \n\nIdentifies patients with ulcers caused by inadequate venous circulation in the area affected (usually lower legs). \nThis lesion is often associated with stasis dermatitis. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care  \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  Physical assessment and observation are the preferred approach to determine the presence of stasis ulcers. \nPatient/caregiver report, medical records including physician/allowed practitioner orders and input may be \nused. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIt is important to differentiate stasis ulcers from other types of skin lesions, and only report stasis ulcers in this \nitem. \n\n\u2022  Stasis ulcers DO NOT include arterial lesions or arterial ulcers. \n\n\u2022  Once a stasis ulcer has completely epithelialized, it is considered healed and should not be reported as a \n\ncurrent stasis ulcer.", "type": "Document"}}
