If data quality problems exist, the problems can be corrected. If clinical documentation \nmust be amended, this is done according to agency policy. Any corrections to OASIS data in the clinical record \nmust also be reflected in the OASIS database maintained by the agency, and if data submission has already \noccurred, a correction must be transmitted to CMS. \n\n2.2.3 Clinical Audit Visits \n\nClinical audit visits provide an opportunity to verify the quality of patient status data collected by assessing \nclinicians. We recommend that agencies conduct supervisory (or peer) audit visits to at least three to four \npatients each quarter. These audit visits should occur at the admission comprehensive assessment visit, as well as \nat other time points based on agency needs and goals. Within a one-year period, each clinical staff member of an \naverage-sized agency or an agency\u2019s team can receive an audit visit. The supervisor or peer auditor should \ncomplete the OASIS items while observing the assessing clinician conducting the assessment visit. The assessing \nclinician and auditor should not discuss OASIS items between themselves during the visit. The QI coordinator \n(or designated person) then compares each code on the OASIS items completed by the assessing clinician to the \nOASIS codes completed by the auditor. Discrepancies should be noted. Any differences", "type": "Document"}}
