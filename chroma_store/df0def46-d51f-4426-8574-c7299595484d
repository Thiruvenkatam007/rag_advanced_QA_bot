Scores from a carefully conducted BIMS assessment where patients can hear all questions and the \npatient is not delirious suggest the following distributions: \n\n\u2022  13-15: cognitively intact \n\n\u2022  8-12: moderately impaired \n\n\u2022  0-7: severe impairment \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  After completing C0200-C0400: \n\no  Add up the values for all questions from C0200 through C0400. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n76 \n\n![CO5Oo.BlMSSummaTy\nEnterCode\nAdd scoresfor questionsC0200-C0400and fillin.total score (00-15)\nEnter99ifthepotientwasunabletocompletetheinterview](#)\n\fChapter 3 \n\nCoding Instructions \n\nSection C: Cognitive Patterns \n\n\u2022  Enter the total score as a two-digit number.

If, however, the patient chooses not to answer four or more items, then \nthe interview is coded as incomplete. \n\no  To be considered a completed interview, the patient had to attempt and provide relevant answers to at least \nfour of the questions included in C0200-C0400C. To be relevant, a response only must be related to the \nquestion (logical); it does not have to be correct.
