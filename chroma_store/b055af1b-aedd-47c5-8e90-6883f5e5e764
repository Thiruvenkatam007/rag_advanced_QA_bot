If the patient is not able to \n\nstand, the activity did not occur and the appropriate \u201cactivity not attempted\u201d code would be used. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf a standing patient is unable to pick up a small object from the floor, therefore requiring the helper to pick \nup the object, code 01, 02, or 03, depending on whether the helper is providing all the effort, more than half of \nthe effort, or less than half of the effort. Clinicians should use clinical judgment to apply guidance regarding a \npatient\u2019s degree of participation in picking up an object. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The patient has a neurologic condition that has resulted in coordination and balance problems. At SOC, the \n\npatient reports they and their spouse worked with the OT in the SNF on picking things up from the floor. The \npatient demonstrates how they stoop to pick up a pencil from the floor as their spouse provides the right \namount of verbal cues for safety and stands by, ready to help in case the patient loses their balance. \no  Coding: GG0170P, Picking up object would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. \no  Rationale: A helper is needed to provide verbal cues and stand-by assistance when the patient picks up an \n\nobject due to their coordination and balance limitations. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n152\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection H: Bladder and Bowel", "type": "Document"}}
