Its initial purpose was to provide a standardized home \nhealth item set and standardized quality measures for use in quality improvement activities within individual home \nhealth agencies. The uses for OASIS data quickly expanded beyond quality measurement to also include \ndetermining reimbursement under Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). The uses for OASIS data have \ncontinued to evolve over the years with significant quality and payment implications tied to OASIS data. The \ncurrent uses for OASIS include: 1) Home Health Agency Medicare-certification surveys, 2) the quality measures \non the consumer-focused Care Compare website, 3) the quality measures used in the Home Health Quality of \nPatient Care Star Ratings, 4) the quality measures used in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \nHome Health Value- Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model, and 5) the Quality Assessment Only (QAO) Metric \nused in home health pay-for- reporting (P4R). The OASIS instrument also plays a pivotal role in post-acute care \nquality improvement related to the mandates of the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of \n2014 (IMPACT Act). \n\nHISTORY OF OASIS AND OUTCOME-BASED QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (OBQI) \n\nIn the early 2000s, CMS promoted a quality improvement process for home health called Outcome-Based Quality \nImprovement (OBQI). OBQI used OASIS-based quality measures as the foundation for home health quality \nimprovement activities. CMS, through their contracts with state Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), \nprovided training to home health agencies nationally on OBQI. Agency training and the use of OBQI to improve \nquality was a preparatory step for the home health public reporting of quality measures.", "type": "Document"}}
