In addition, if care \nproviders from two disciplines perform assessments on the patient within one week of SOC (for example, \nregistered nurse conducts comprehensive assessment visit and completes OASIS items; the physical therapist \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n7\n\fChapter 3 \n\nItem-by-Item Guide to the OASIS Assessment \n\nvisits two days later and evaluates the patient), the documentation would be compared. Reviewers would \nevaluate whether any discrepancies between the SOC OASIS assessment and the other documentation are \nsufficiently significant to indicate a data quality problem. For example, if the SOC OASIS items indicate that the \npatient is fully independent in ambulation, but other documentation indicates that the patient needs assistance \nwhen walking, a data quality problem may exist. Assess for any discrepancies between sociodemographic items \n(for example, payment source or birth date) in addition to discrepancies in clinical assessments (ICD-10-CM \ncodes, all clinical assessment OASIS items). \n\nThe records for discharged patients could be reviewed in the same manner. All discharge OASIS patient status \nitems would be compared to other discharge information as well as to the previous two or three visit notes (if \nthose visits occur within the same week of discharge). If there are unexpected/unexplainable differences in \ndescriptions of the patient, a potential data quality problem may exist.", "type": "Document"}}
