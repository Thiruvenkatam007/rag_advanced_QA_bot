May also \npresent as an intact or open/ruptured serum-filled blister. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\nDischarge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  Staging of a pressure ulcer/injury should be determined by physical assessment and observation. Medical \n\nrecords, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be used for historical purposes only to identify the \npresence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a previously healed pressure ulcer. \n\n\u2022  Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was \n\npreviously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it \nshould continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. \n\n\u2022  Do not reverse stage pressure ulcers as a way to document healing as it does not accurately. \n\n\u2022  characterize what is physiologically occurring as the ulcer heals. For example, over time, even though a Stage 4 \n\npressure ulcer has been healing and contracting such that it is less deep, wide, and long, the \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "type": "Document"}}
