During the SOC/ROC assessment, the patient states they prefer to participate in oral hygiene twice daily. On \nassessment, the clinician identifies that the patient\u2019s caregiver completes more than half of this activity. The \npatient has severe arthritis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetic neuropathy, and renal failure.
