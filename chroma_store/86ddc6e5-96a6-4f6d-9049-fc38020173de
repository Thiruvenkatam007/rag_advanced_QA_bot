The turns may \n\noccur at any time during the 50-foot walk. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to the \nright or two 90 degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90 degree turn to the left and one \n90 degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person\u2019s ability level and can include use \nof an assistive device (for example, cane). \n\nExamples \n\n1.  At SOC, the patient is recovering from a recent stroke and now has difficulty walking. Even with assistance, \n\nthey walk only 30 feet.  \no  Coding: GG0170J, Walk 50 feet with two turns, SOC Performance would be coded 88, Not attempted due \n\nto medical condition or safety concerns. \n\no  Rationale: The patient is ambulatory but was not able to walk the entire distance because of their new \n\nmedical condition (stroke). Since the patient is unable to complete the activity at SOC, but was completing \nthe activity prior to the recent stroke, Code 88 is appropriate.  \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n148\n\fChapter 3 \n\nGG0170K Walk 150 feet \n\nSection H: Bladder and Bowel \n\nDEFINITION \n\nWALK 150 FEET  \nOnce standing, the ability to walk at least 150 feet in a corridor or similar space. \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022  Starting from standing, the activity includes the patient\u2019s ability to walk 150 feet. \n\n\u2022  When coding GG0170K, if the patient\u2019s environment does not accommodate a walk of 150 feet without turns, \n\nbut the patient demonstrates the ability to walk with or without assistance 150 feet with turns without \njeopardizing the patient\u2019s safety, code using the 6-point scale.", "type": "Document"}}
