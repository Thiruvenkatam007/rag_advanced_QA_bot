The patient is being admitted to home health for pressure ulcer care. They have complete tetraplegia from an \ninjury one year ago and have been unable to bear weight in standing since the injury.

This could be a chair-to-chair \n\ntransfer that does not include the bed. \n\n\u2022  Depending on the patient\u2019s abilities, the transfer may be a stand-pivot, squat-pivot, or a slide board transfer. \n\n\u2022  When possible, the transfer should be assessed in an environmental situation where taking more than a few \n\nsteps would not be necessary to complete the transfer. \n\n\u2022", "type": "Document"}}
