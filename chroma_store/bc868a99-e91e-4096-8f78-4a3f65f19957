A patient tries to answer all questions during the BIMS. Although they answer several items incorrectly and \nrespond \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d to others, the patient pays attention to the assessing clinician. The family indicates \nthat this is the patient\u2019s consistent behavior. \no  Coding: C1310B would be coded 0, Behavior not present. \no  Rationale: The patient remained focused throughout the assessment, and this was constant during the day \n\nof assessment. \n\n2.  Questions during the BIMS must be frequently repeated because the patient\u2019s attention wanders. This \n\nbehavior occurs throughout the assessment. The family agrees that this behavior is consistently present. The \npatient has a diagnosis of dementia. \no  Coding: C1310B would be coded 1, Behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate. \no  Rationale: The patient\u2019s attention consistently wandered throughout the assessment. The patient\u2019s \n\ndementia diagnosis does not affect the coding. \n\n3.  During the BIMS interview, the patient was not able to focus on all questions asked and their gaze wandered. \nHowever, the family confirmed that the patient was attentive prior to the nurse arriving for the home health \nvisit. \no  Coding: C1310B would be coded 2, Behavior present, fluctuates. \no  Rationale: Evidence of inattention was found during the assessment, but the family indicated the patient \nhad been attentive earlier in the day. This disagreement shows possible fluctuation in the behavior. If any \ninformation source reports the symptom as present, C1310B cannot be coded as 0, Behavior not present. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n81\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection C: Cognitive Patterns", "type": "Document"}}
