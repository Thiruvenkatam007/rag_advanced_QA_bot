The challenge in outcome \nanalysis is to attempt to somehow separate changes due to care from those due to natural progression. Statistical \nrisk adjustment refers to a collection of analytic methods designed to separate the relationship of outcomes with \ncare provided from the relationship of outcomes with natural progression of disease and disability, which is \ncritical to accurate outcome analysis. One of the major purposes of OASIS is to provide data items needed for risk \nadjustment. In essence, the general intent of risk adjustment is to compensate or adjust for differences in case mix \nor risk factors (between agency and a comparison sample) that should be taken into consideration if outcomes are \nto be compared validly. Risk adjustment compensates or controls for the potential influence of case mix variables \n(i.e., risk factors) that can affect outcomes. \n\nThe OASIS-based quality measures are calculated using items from the OASIS assessments from Medicare FFS, \nMedicare Advantage, Medicaid, and Medicaid Managed care. For a set of these quality measures a logistic \nregression prediction model is created. Hundreds of risk factors are tested in the development of prediction \nmodels. Risk models are quality measure specific. A rigorous, multi-step process is followed that includes clinical \nreview of the scientifically identified risk factors. Hence, the result of applying this prediction model for any \nepisode of care is, in fact, the predicted value based on this logistic regression equation. \n\nA subset of the OASIS-based outcome quality measures is risk adjusted. The OASIS-based process quality \nmeasures are not risk adjusted.", "type": "Document"}}
