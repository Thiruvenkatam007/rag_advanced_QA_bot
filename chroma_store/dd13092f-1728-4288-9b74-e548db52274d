May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum-filled blister.\n\nSTAGE 3 PRESSURE ULCER \n\n\u2022\n\nStage 3 pressure ulcers are characterized by full thickness tissue loss.\nSubcutaneous fat may be visible, but bone, tendon or muscle is not exposed. \nSlough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May \ninclude undermining or tunneling. \n\nSTAGE 4 PRESSURE ULCER \n\n\u2022\n\nStage 4 pressure ulcers are characterized by full thickness tissue loss with\nexposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some\nparts of the wound bed. Often includes undermining and tunneling.\n\nAt discharge, this item also identifies if each pressure ulcer/injury present on the discharge assessment was \nobserved at the same stage at the time of the most recent SOC/ROC. \n\nStage 1 pressure injuries and all healed pressure ulcers/injuries are not reported in this item. \n\nItem Rationale \n\nIt is important to recognize and evaluate each patient\u2019s risk factors for developing skin ulcers, wounds, or lesions, \nand to identify and evaluate all areas at risk of constant pressure. A complete assessment of skin is essential to an \neffective pressure ulcer/injury prevention and skin treatment program. It is imperative to determine the etiology of \nall wounds and lesions, as this will determine and direct the proper treatment and management of the wound. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022 Start of Care\n\n\u2022 Resumption of Care\n\n\u2022 Discharge from agency\n\nResponse-Specific Instructions", "type": "Document"}}
