The patient can be observed in their normal environment. Do they respond \n(e.g., turn their head) when a noise is made at a normal level? Does the patient seem to respond only to \nspecific noise in a quiet environment? Assess whether the patient responds only to loud noise or do they not \nrespond at all. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  When asked about whether they can hear normal conversation without difficulty, the patient responds, \n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m at home, I usually keep the TV on a low volume and hear it just fine.
