This \nmeans that for the purposes of counting the 14-day period, the Start of Care date is day 0 and the day \nimmediately prior to the Start of Care date is day 1. For example, if the patient\u2019s SOC date is August 20, any \nconfusion reported or observed on or after August 6 and prior to the HHA admission would be reported. \n\u2022  \u201cNonresponsive\u201d means that the patient is unable to respond, or the patient responds in a way that you cannot \n\nmake a clinical judgment about the patient\u2019s level of orientation. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the patient is nonresponsive at the time of assessment, elicit from the caregiver or other sources whether the \npatient experienced any confusion during the past 14 days.", "type": "Document"}}
