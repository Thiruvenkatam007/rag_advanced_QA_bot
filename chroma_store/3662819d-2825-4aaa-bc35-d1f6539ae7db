A number of OASIS-based quality measures are calculated for \u201cimprovement\u201d \nand/or \u201cstabilization.\u201d For example, there is a measure for \u201cImprovement in Bathing\u201d and there is also a quality \nmeasure for \u201cStabilization in Bathing.\u201d How then is \u201cstabilization\u201d measured? For the OASIS-based quality \nmeasures, stabilization is calculated as all patients who did not worsen for the measure. Stabilization includes all \npatients who remain numerically the same on the OASIS response scale (i.e., \u201cstabilized\u201d) from start of care or \nresumption of care to discharge AND all patients who improved (moved from a higher numeric score to a lower \nnumeric score). \n\nAs the stabilization quality measures include all patients who have stabilized AND all patients who have \nimproved, the measure rates for the stabilization quality measures are much higher than the corresponding \nimprovement quality measure rates. For example, at the time of development of this manual, the \u201cImprovement in \nBathing\u201d national reference rate was approximately 82%. However, the \u201cStabilization in Bathing\u201d national \nreference rate was approximately 98% as the stabilization rate includes patients who numerically stay the same for \nOASIS M1830 AND patients who numerically improve in the OASIS M1830 score. \n\nOASIS & QUALITY MEASURE REPORTS \n\nCMS provides several quality measure reports.
