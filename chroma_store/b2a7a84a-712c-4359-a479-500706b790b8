Definitions of \n\npressure ulcer/injury stages are in guidance for M1311, Current Number of Unhealed Pressure \nUlcers/Injuries. A pressure ulcer/injury is considered unstageable if: \n\u00ad  It is covered with a non-removable dressing/device, such as a cast, that cannot be removed. \n\u00ad  The wound bed is obscured by some degree of necrotic tissue AND no bone, muscle, tendon, or joint \ncapsule (Stage 4 structures) are visible. Note that if a Stage 4 structure is visible, the pressure ulcer is \nreportable as a Stage 4 even if slough or eschar is present. \n\n\u00ad  It presents as a deep tissue injury. \n\no  Step 2: Determine which stageable pressure ulcer/injury is the most problematic. \n\n\u00ad  \u201cMost problematic\u201d may be the largest, the most advanced stage, the most difficult to access for \n\ntreatment, the most difficult to relieve pressure, etc., depending on the specific situation. \n\u00ad  If the patient has only one stageable pressure ulcer, then that ulcer is the most problematic. \n\n\u2022  Enter \u201cNA\u201d if the patient has NO pressure ulcers or only has pressure ulcers that are unstageable at the time of \n\nthe assessment. \n\n\u2022  Stage 1 pressure injuries, although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed. \n\n\u2022  Dash is not a valid response for this item. \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022  Pressure ulcers/injuries that have healed are not considered for this item.", "type": "Document"}}
