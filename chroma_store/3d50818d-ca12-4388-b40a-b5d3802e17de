Only a little assistance from a helper is needed to pull \nup their garments over the hips. The patient requires the helper to fasten the knee brace because of grasp and \nfine motor weakness. \no  Coding: GG0130G would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. \no  Rationale: A helper provides only a little assistance when the patient is putting on their lower extremity \ngarments and fastening the knee brace. The helper provides less than half of the effort. Assistance putting \non and removing the knee brace is considered when determining the type and amount of assistance \nrequired when coding lower body dressing. \n\nGG0130H Putting on/taking off footwear \n\nDEFINITION \n\nPUTTING ON/TAKING OFF FOOTWEAR \nThe ability to put on and take off socks and shoes or other footwear that is appropriate for \nsafe mobility; including fasteners, if applicable. \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022  Footwear dressing items to consider when coding GG0130H include but are not limited to socks, shoes, boots, \n\nand running shoes.", "type": "Document"}}
