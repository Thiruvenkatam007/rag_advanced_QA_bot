These rules consider the \n\"number of missing items in Column 2\" which is the number of items in Column 2 that are skipped. An item \nin Column 2 is skipped if the corresponding item in Column 1 was equal to 9 (no response) or a dash \n(symptom presence not assessed). \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf all the items in Column 2 have a value of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., they all contain non-missing values), then item \nD0160 is equal to the simple sum of those values. \n\nIf any of the items in Column 2 are blank (or skipped), then omit their values when computing the sum. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n94\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection D: Mood \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to one, then compute the simple sum of the eight items in \nColumn 2 that have non-missing values, multiply the sum by 9/8 (1.125), and place the result rounded to the \nnearest integer in item D0160. \n\nIf the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to two, then compute the simple sum of the seven items \nin Column 2 that have non-missing values, multiply the sum by 9/7 (1.286), and place the result rounded to \nthe nearest integer in item D0160. \n\nIf the number of missing items in Column 2 is equal to three or more, then item D0160 must equal [99]. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  All Items in Column 2 Have Non-missing Values \n\nThe following example shows how to score the Patient interview when all of the items in Column 2 have non-\nmissing values: \n\nItem \nD0150A2 \nD0150B2 \nD0150C2 \nD0150D2 \nD0150E2 \nD0150F2 \nD0150G2 \nD0150H2 \nD0150I2 \nD0160 \n\nValue \n1 \n2 \n3 \n0 \n3 \n0 \n1 \n3 \n2 \n14 \n\n\u2022  Rationale: In this example, all the items in Column 2 have non-missing values (i.e., none of the values are \n\nblank, or skipped). Therefore, the value of D0160 is equal to the simple sum of the values in Column 2, which \nis 14. \n\n2.  One Missing Value in Column 2", "type": "Document"}}
