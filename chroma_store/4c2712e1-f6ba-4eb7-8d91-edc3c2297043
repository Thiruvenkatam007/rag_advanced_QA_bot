Processes to promote data accuracy may include clinical record audits, data \nentry audits, reports produced from electronic health record systems or other activities. Routine agency OASIS \ndata audits are recommended, with audit frequency determined by the agency. Some data audit activities might \nbe conducted monthly, while others conducted at less frequent intervals, such as quarterly. \n\nThe following guidelines offer examples of approaches for monitoring the quality of OASIS data in an agency. \nTypes of audits, their recommended frequency, and categories of staff members (to conduct data audit activities \nand summarize findings) are suggested. Use of these approaches is not mandated by CMS, nor do they ensure \nregulatory compliance. If problems are identified, it is also recommended that the agency develop and implement \na plan to correct data quality problems. Table 1 displays the data quality audit approaches discussed and \nsummarizes the purpose, frequency, and procedures for each. \n\nTable 2.1: Data Quality Audits \n\nAudit Type \n\nClinical \nRecord Audit \n\nPurpose \n\nTo verify accuracy of OASIS \npatient status items compared to \nother related patient \ndocumentation \n\nFrequency \n\nMonthly \n\nClinical Audit \nVisits \n\nTo verify accuracy of OASIS \nassessment data (that is, \nevaluate Assessment \nmethodology and assessment \nskills of clinical staff) \n\nQuarterly \n\nPerformed By \n\nQI Coordinator \n\nQI Coordinator, \nClinical Supervisor, \nor Clinical Staff \n\nOverview of Procedure", "type": "Document"}}
