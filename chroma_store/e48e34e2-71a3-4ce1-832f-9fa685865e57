The GG0130 Self Care and GG0170 Mobility \nitems are revised to remove the Discharge Goals, due to the removal of the Application of Percent of Long-Term \nCare Hospital (LTCH) Patients with an Admission and Discharge Functional Assessment and a Care Plan that \nAddresses Function (Application of Functional Assessment/Care Plan), also finalized in the CY2024 HH final \nrule. One item, D0150 Patient Health Questionnaire, is revised to clarify the instructions.  \n\n1.4.1 What\u2019s new with the OASIS instrument for version E1? \n\n\u2022  One new item has been added (O0350) \n\n\u2022  Two items are removed (M0110, M2200) \n\n\u2022  Three items are revised (GG0130, GG0170, D0150) \n\n\u2022  Updated skip pattern (M0102) \n\nRefer to Appendix D for a more detailed description of instrument and guidance changes. \n\n1.5 OASIS Requirements \nThis section provides a basic overview of collecting OASIS data.
