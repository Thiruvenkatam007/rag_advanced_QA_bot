The Stage 3 pressure ulcer observed on the discharge skin assessment\nis reported \u201cpresent at the most recent SOC/ROC\u201d because that is the stage at which the DTI observed at\nthe SOC assessment first became numerically stageable.\n\n2. Deep tissue injury (DTI) with intact skin at SOC, becomes numerically stageable and increases in numerical\n\nstage by discharge\n\nThe RN completes a skin assessment during the SOC visit for a patient and identifies a right hip DTI with\nintact skin. This DTI is first numerically stageable 10 days later as a Stage 3 pressure ulcer and increases in\nnumerical stage five days after that, to a Stage 4 pressure ulcer. The pressure ulcer remains Stage 4 at\ndischarge.\no Coding: On the DC discharge assessment M1311C1, Number of Stage 4 pressure ulcers, would be coded\n\u201c1\u201d.
