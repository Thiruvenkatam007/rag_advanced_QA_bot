The assessing clinician asks a patient, who is often confused, to give the date, and the patient\u2019s response is: \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get the sailor suits!\u201d The patient continues to provide irrelevant or nonsensical responses throughout \nthe interview, and their family indicates this is constant. \no  Coding: C1310C would be coded 1, Behavior continuously present, does not fluctuate.  \no  Rationale: All sources agree that the disorganized thinking is constant. \n\n2.  A patient responds that the year is 1837 when asked to give the date. Their family indicates that the patient is \n\nnever oriented to time but has relevant conversations and does not ramble with incoherent speech. For \nexample, the family reports the patient often discusses their passion for baseball. \no  Coding: C1310C would be coded 0, Behavior not present. \no  Rationale: The patient\u2019s answer was related to the question, even though it was incorrect. No other \n\nsources report disorganized thinking. \n\n3.  The patient was able to tell the assessing clinician their name, the year and where they were. The patient was \nable to talk about the activity they just attended in the assisted living facility and the residents and staff that \nalso attended.
