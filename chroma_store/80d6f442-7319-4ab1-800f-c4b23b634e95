At each required OASIS time point, the assessing clinician must \nassess the patient\u2019s clinical status and determine the primary and other diagnoses based on patient status and \ntreatment plan at the time of the assessment. \n\n\u2022  Only current diagnoses should be reported as primary and secondary diagnoses in M1021 and M1023. \n\nDiagnoses should be excluded if they are resolved or do not have the potential to impact the skilled services \nprovided by the HHA. An example of a resolved condition is cholecystitis following a cholecystectomy.", "type": "Document"}}
