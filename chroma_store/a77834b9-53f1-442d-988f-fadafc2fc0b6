Deep Tissue Injury (DTI) with intact skin at SOC, becomes numerically stageable, then is unstageable due to \n\nslough and/or eschar at discharge \n\nThe RN assesses a patient\u2019s skin during the assessment timeframe for the SOC and identifies a DTI with intact \nskin on the patient\u2019s right heel. This DTI first becomes numerically stageable at the third home visit, as a \nStage 3 pressure ulcer. At the discharge skin assessment, this pressure ulcer is unstageable due to slough and \neschar. \no  Coding: On the discharge assessment, M1311E1, Number of unstageable pressure ulcers due to slough \nand/or eschar, would be coded \u201c1\u201d. M1311E2, Number of these unstageable pressure ulcers that were \npresent at the most recent SOC/ROC, would be coded \u201c0\u201d. M1311F1, Unstageable pressure injuries \npresenting as DTI, would be coded \u201c0\u201d. (Skip M1311F2). \n\no  Rationale: The DTI with intact skin observed on the SOC skin assessment first became stageable as a \n\nStage 3 pressure ulcer. This ulcer did not remain Stage 3, however. At the discharge skin assessment, the \nulcer was unstageable due to slough and eschar. Any pressure ulcer/injury that is unstageable due to \nslough and/or eschar at discharge, but was previously numerically stageable, is considered new, and not \ncoded as \u201cpresent at the most recent SOC/ROC.\u201d \n\nM1322: Current Number of Stage 1 Pressure Injuries \n\nItem Intent \n\nIdentifies the presence and number of Stage 1 pressure injuries. \n\nDEFINITION \n\nSTAGE 1 PRESSURE INJURY \nAn observable, pressure-related alteration of intact skin whose indicators, as compared \nwith an adjacent or opposite area on the body, may include changes in one or more of \nthe following parameters: skin temperature (warmth or coolness); tissue consistency (firm \nor boggy); sensation (pain, itching); and/or a defined area of persistent redness in lightly \npigmented skin. In darker skin tones, the injury may appear with persistent red, blue, or \npurple hues. \n\nItem Rationale", "type": "Document"}}
