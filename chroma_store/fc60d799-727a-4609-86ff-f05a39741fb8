Unstageable pressure ulcers/injuries, whether covered with a non-removable dressing or eschar or \nslough, would not be considered healed. \n\n\u2022  Stage 2 (partial thickness) pressure ulcers heal through the process of regeneration of the epidermis across a \n\nwound surface, known as \u201cre-epithelialization.\u201d \n\n\u2022  Stage 3 and 4 (full thickness) pressure ulcers heal through a process of granulation (filling of the wound with \n\nconnective/scar tissue), contraction (wound margins contract and pull together), and re-epithelialization (covers \nwith epithelial tissue from within wound bed and/or from wound margins). Once the pressure ulcer has fully \ngranulated and the wound surface is completely covered with new epithelialtissue, the wound is considered \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n189\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection M: Skin Conditions \n\nclosed, and will continue to remodel and increase in tensile strength.
