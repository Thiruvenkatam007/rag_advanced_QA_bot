Does not include \nthe ability to open/close door or fasten seat belt. \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022  The activity includes the patient\u2019s ability to transfer in and out of a car or van seat on the passenger side. \n\n\u2022  Any vehicle model available may be used for the assessment of GG0170G, Car transfer. \n\n\u2022  The car transfer could still be completed while accommodating medical restrictions such as long sitting. \n\n\u2022  The Car transfer does not include getting to or from the vehicle, opening/closing the car door, or \n\nfastening/unfastening the seat belt. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the patient remains in a wheelchair and does not transfer in and out of a car or van seat, the activity is not \nconsidered completed and the appropriate \u201cactivity not attempted\u201d code would be used. \n\n\u2022  The setup and/or clean-up of an assistive device that is used for walking to and from the car, but not used  \nfor the transfer in and out of the car seat, would not be considered when coding the car transfer activity. \n\n\u2022  Clinicians may use clinical judgment to determine if observing a patient performing a portion of the car \n\ntransfer activity (e.g., getting into the car) allows the clinician to adequately assess the patient\u2019s ability to \ncomplete the entire GG0170G, Car transfer activity (transferring in and out of a car). If the clinician \ndetermines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistance required to \ncomplete the activity. \n\n\u2022  Use of an \u201cactivity not attempted\u201d code should occur only after determining that the car transfer activity is not \ncompleted, and the performance code cannot be determined based on patient/caregiver report, collaboration \nwith other agency staff, or assessment of similar activities. \n\nExample \n\n1.  The patient uses a wheelchair and ambulates for only short distances. At SOC, the patient requires the", "type": "Document"}}
