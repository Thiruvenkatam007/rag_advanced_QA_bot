If the patient eats finger foods with their hands independently, for example, the patient \nwould be coded as 06, Independent. \n\nIf the patient eats and drinks by mouth and relies partially on obtaining nutrition and liquids via tube feedings \nor parenteral nutrition, code eating based on the amount of assistance the patient requires to eat and drink by \nmouth. \n\n\u2022  Assistance with tube feedings and parenteral nutrition is not considered when coding this activity. \n\n\u2022  Code 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety concerns if the patient does not eat or drink by \nmouth and relies solely on nutrition and liquids through tube feedings or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due \nto a new (recent onset) medical condition. \n\n\u2022  Code 09, Not applicable, if the patient does not eat or drink by mouth at the time of the assessment, and the \n\npatient did not eat or drink by mouth prior to the current illness, injury, or exacerbation. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The patient does not have any food consistency restrictions, but often needs to swallow two or three times so \nthat the food clears their throat due to difficulty with pharyngeal peristalsis. They require verbal cues to use \nthe compensatory strategy of extra swallows to clear the food. \no  Coding: GG0130A, Eating would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. \no  Rationale: The patient swallows all types of food consistencies and requires verbal cueing (supervision) \nfrom the helper.
