High-risk medications should be identified \nbased on one or more authoritative sources (e.g., the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, the American \nGeriatrics Society, and The Joint Commission) and would be identified from medications included on the \npatient\u2019s reconciled medication profile. \n\n\u2022  High-risk medications are those identified by an authoritative source as having considerable potential for \n\ncausing significant patient harm when they are used erroneously. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf agency staff other than the clinician responsible for completing the SOC/ROC provided high-risk medication \neducation to the patient/caregiver, this information may be communicated to the assessing clinician for \nconsideration in completing the SOC/ROC OASIS assessment.
