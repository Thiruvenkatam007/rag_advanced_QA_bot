The data set, called the Outcomes \nand Assessment Information Set (OASIS), measured quality across all HHAs, to produce outcome measures and \nreports and serve as the basis of outcomes-based quality improvement (OBQI). Selected OASIS items were later \nidentified for use in payment determination in the Prospective Payment System (PPS). \n\n1   Shaughnessy PW, Crisler KS, Schlenker RI, Arnold AG, Kramer AM, Powell MC, and Hittle DF.
