The patient uses a wheelchair and ambulates for only short distances. At SOC, the patient requires the \n\nphysical therapist to lift most of their weight to get from a seated position in the wheelchair to a standing \nposition. The therapist provides trunk support when the patient takes several steps during the transfer turn. \nThe patient lowers themself into the car seat with steadying assistance from the therapist. The patient moves \ntheir legs into the car as the therapist lifts the weight of their legs from the ground. \no  Coding: GG0170G, Car transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal assistance. \no  Rationale: The therapist completed more than half the effort to transfer the patient into the car by \n\nproviding significant lifting assistance from the wheelchair, trunk support when taking steps toward the car \nseat, steadying when lowering into the car seat and lifting support when moving legs into the car. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n146\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection H: Bladder and Bowel \n\n2.  The day after being admitted to home health, the patient is evaluated by an occupational therapist on transfers \nin and out of the passenger side of a car. When reviewing the therapist\u2019s evaluation, the assessing clinician \nreads that when performing car transfers, the patient required verbal reminders for safety and contact guarding \nassistance from the OT. Documentation showed that the therapist opened and closed the car door. \no  Coding: GG0170G, Car transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 04, Supervision or touching \n\nassistance. \n\no  Rationale: The therapist provides verbal cues and touching assistance only as the patient transfers in and \nout of the passenger seat of the car. Assistance with opening and closing the car door is not included in the \ndefinition of this item and is not considered when coding this item.", "type": "Document"}}
