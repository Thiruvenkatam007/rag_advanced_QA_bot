If the PRN medication was not needed during the assessment timeframe, use \nclinical judgment, and make an inference regarding the patient\u2019s ability by asking them to describe and \ndemonstrate the steps for administration and needle disposal, considering the patient\u2019s cognitive and physical \nstatus as well as any other barriers. \n\n\u2022  Assessment strategies: A combined observation/interview approach with the patient or caregiver is helpful in \ndetermining the most accurate response for this item. Observe patient preparing injectable medications. If it is \nnot time for the medication, ask the patient to describe and demonstrate the steps for administration.
