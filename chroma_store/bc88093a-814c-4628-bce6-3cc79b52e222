Item-specific \nguidance and examples follow. \n\n\u2022  Assessment of the walking activities starts with the patient in a standing position. \n\n\u2022  Code based on the type and amount of assistance required to complete the walking activity, with or without \n\nthe use of assistive devices or adaptive equipment. \n\n\u2022  Use of assistive device(s) and adaptive equipment (for instance a cane or leg brace) required to complete the \n\nwalking activity should not automatically result in the reporting of a more dependent code. \n\n\u2022  The walking activities cannot be completed without some level of patient participation that allows patient \n\nambulation to occur for the entire stated distance. A helper cannot complete a walking activity for a patient. \n\n\u2022  During a walking activity, a patient may take a brief standing rest break. If the patient needs to sit to rest \n\nduring a GG walking activity, consider the patient unable to complete the walking activity. \n\n\u2022  Report an appropriate \u201cactivity not attempted\u201d code when the patient requires a sitting rest break, and/or \n\ncannot complete the walking activity with the assistance of one or more helpers. \n\n\u2022  Clinicians can use clinical judgment to determine how the actual patient assessment of walking is conducted. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf a clinician chooses to combine the assessment of multiple walking activities, use clinical judgment to \ndetermine the type and amount of assistance needed for each individual activity. \n\n\u2022  Use clinical judgment when assessing activities that overlap or occur sequentially to determine the type and \n\namount of assistance needed for each individual activity. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022", "type": "Document"}}
