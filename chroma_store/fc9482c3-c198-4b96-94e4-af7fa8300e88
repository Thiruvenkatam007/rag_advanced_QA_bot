Scheduled suctioning is performed \n\nwhen the patient is assessed to clinically benefit from regular interventions, such as every hour. Scheduled \nsuctioning applies to medical orders for performing suctioning at specific intervals and/or implementation \nof agency-based clinical standards, protocols, and guidelines. \n\no  Code O0110D3, Suctioning, As needed, if suctioning is performed on an as needed basis, as opposed to \nregular scheduled intervals, such as when secretions become so prominent that gurgling or choking is \nnoted, or a sudden desaturation occurs from a mucus plug.", "type": "Document"}}
