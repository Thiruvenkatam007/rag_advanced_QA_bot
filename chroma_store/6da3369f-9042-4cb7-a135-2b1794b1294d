Home Health Review and Correct \n\nReport \n\nCMS provides a quarterly Quality Assessments \nOnly (QAO) Performance Report and a year- end \nHistorical Quality Assessments Only (QAO) \nPerformance Report. This report is based on \nOASIS assessments submitted by an HHA during \nthe applicable reporting period as it relates to \ncompliance with OASIS submission requirements \nfor the Annual Payment Update (APU). \n\nThese reports provide quarterly measure results, \ndisplaying four quarters of data.  A new quarter is \nadded on the first day of each calendar quarter. \nThese reports are updated weekly to provide \nconfidential agency-level and patient-level \nperformance for the OASIS-based quality \nmeasures that are publicly reported on Care \nCompare. The purpose of these reports is to \nprovide agencies with an opportunity to review \nand correct their quality measure data before it is \npublicly reported. \n\nThese reports are placed in the HHA\u2019s iQIES \nfolder. Agencies can use these reports to \nmonitor their compliance with Home Health \npay-for-reporting requirements. \n\nAgencies can use these reports in \nconjunction with the other iQIES quality \nmeasure reports to determine if they have \nany data submission errors that may affect \nagency-level performance for one or more of \nthe quality measures.", "type": "Document"}}
