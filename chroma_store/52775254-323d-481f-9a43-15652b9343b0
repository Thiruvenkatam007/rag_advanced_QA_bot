Since the use of \nopioids is associated with serious complications, an array of successful non-pharmacologic and non-opioid \napproaches to pain management may be considered. There are a range of pain management strategies that can be \nutilized, including but not limited to non-narcotic analgesic drugs, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation \n(TENS) therapy, supportive devices, acupuncture, biofeedback, application of heat/cold, massage, physical \ntherapy, nerve block, stretching and strengthening exercises, chiropractic, electric stimulation, radiotherapy, and \nultrasound. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care  \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n168 \n\n![J0510.Pain Effecton Sleep\nEnterCode\nAskpatient:Overthepast5days,how much ofthe timehaspain modeit hard foryou tosleep atnight\uff1f\n0.\nDoesnot apply-Ihave not hadany pain or hurting in the past 5 days\u2192Skip to M1400,Short of\nBreath at SOC/ROC,Skipto J18O0,AnyFalsSinceSOC/ROCatDC\n1.\nRarely or not at all\n2.\nOccasionally\n3.\nFrequently\n4.\nAlmost constantly\n8.\nUnable to answer\nJ0520.PainInterferencewith TherapyActivities\nEnter Code\nAskpatient:Over thepast5days,howoftenhaveyou limitedyourparticipationinrehabilitation therapy\nsessions due topain?\n0.\nDoesnot apply-Ihavenotreceived rehabilitation therapy in the past 5 days\n1.\nRarely or not at all\n2.\nOccasionally\n3.\nFrequently\n4.\nAlmost constantly\n8.\nUnable to answer\nJ0530.Pain Interference with Day-to-Day Activities\nEnterCode\nAskpatient:\"Over thepast5days,howoftenyou have limitedyour day-to-dayactivities(excluding\nrehabilitation therapy sessions)because ofpain?\n1.\nRarely or not at all\n2.\nOccasionally\n3.\nFrequently\n4.\nAlmost constantly\n8.\nUnable to answer](#)\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions", "type": "Document"}}
