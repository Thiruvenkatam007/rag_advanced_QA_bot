An example of items that could be on a reconciled medication list can be but are not \nlimited to a list of the current prescribed and over-the-counter medications, nutritional supplements, vitamins, \nand/or homeopathic and herbal products administered by any route at the time of discharge or transfer. A \nreconciled medication list could also include important information about: (1) the patient, including their name, \ndate of birth, active diagnoses, known medication and other allergies, and known drug sensitivities and reactions; \nand (2) each medication, including the name, strength, dose, route of medication administration, frequency or \ntiming, purpose/indication, and/or any special instructions. However, this information serves as guidance and as \nstated prior, the completeness of the medication list is left to the discretion of the providers and patient. \n\nDocumentation sources for reconciled medication list information include electronic and/or paper records. Some \nexamples of such records are discharge summary records, a Medication Administration Record, an Intravenous \nMedication Administration Record, a home medication list, and physician orders. \n\nExamples", "type": "Document"}}
