Compare OASIS items to other \ndocumentation from the SOC or discharge visits \nand from other visits surrounding SOC or \ndischarge. \n\nFor at least three or four patients on a team or \nwithin the agency, a supervisor or peer auditor \nattends the SOC visit. The auditor completes OASIS \nitems while the assessing clinician conducts the \nassessment and completes SOC paperwork. \nOASIS item codes are compared for consistency \nbetween auditor and care provider. Consider similar \nauditing efforts for the additional time points after \nthe SOC. \n\n2.2.1 Clinical Record Audits \n\nClinical record audits allow an agency to monitor the validity of OASIS data. This quality check assesses the \ncongruence of OASIS data with other patient status information found in the clinical record. \n\nTo complete a clinical record audit, an abbreviated record review can be conducted for at least five new \nadmissions and five patients discharged from the agency (but not due to an inpatient facility admission). Records \nshould be randomly selected, in order to evaluate data quality for a cross-section of patients and care providers. \nIn the event that the agency has fewer than five patients admitted to or discharged from the agency, review all \nrecords. It should be noted that many agencies may choose to audit a larger sample, and some may audit 100% of \nrecords. \n\n2.2.2 Procedure for Clinical Record Audits", "type": "Document"}}
