If there is only documentation in the clinical record of a complication such as nephropathy or \nneuropathy and there is no documentation that the patient has diabetes, it should not be assumed the \ncomplication is associated with diabetes, and Response 2, Diabetes Mellitus, should not be checked. \n\nIf a diabetic patient has either PAD or PVD both Response 1 and Response 2 should be checked. \n\n\u2022  The physician (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or other authorized licensed \n\nstaff if allowable under state licensure laws) for example, documents at the time of assessment that the patient \nhas inadequately controlled diabetes and requires adjustment of the medication regimen.
