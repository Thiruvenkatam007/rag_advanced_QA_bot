Report the patient\u2019s physical and cognitive ability to perform a task. Do not report on the patient\u2019s \n\npreference or willingness to perform a specified task. \n\n2.  The level of ability refers to the level of assistance (if any) that the patient requires to safely complete a \nspecified task. Assistance includes verbal cues, reminders, supervision and/or stand-by or hands-on \nassistance. \n\n3.  While the presence or absence of a caregiver may impact the way a patient carries out an activity, it does \nnot impact the assessing clinician\u2019s ability to assess the patient to determine and report the level of \nassistance the patient requires to safely complete a task. \n\n4.  Understand what tasks are included and excluded in each item and select the OASIS response based only \n\non included tasks. \n\n5.  If the patient\u2019s ability varies between the different tasks included in a multi-task item, report what is true in a \n\nmajority of the included tasks, giving more weight to tasks that are more frequently performed. \n\n6.  Consider medical restrictions when determining ability. For example, if the physician/allowed practitioner \nhas ordered activity restrictions, consider this when selecting the best response to functional items related to \nambulation, transferring, bathing, etc.", "type": "Document"}}
