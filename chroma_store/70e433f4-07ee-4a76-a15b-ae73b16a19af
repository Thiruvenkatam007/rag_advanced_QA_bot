In addition to the OASIS- based quality \nmeasures, there are home health quality measures derived from Medicare FFS claims data and Home Health \nCAHPS\u00ae (Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) data. Some agencies may have access to \nadditional quality measures through their health system or payer affiliations, through other programs (such as \nbenchmarking vendors, state collaboratives, etc.), or quality reports generated from their electronic health records. \nHome health agencies are encouraged to use any of these information sources in systematic efforts to continuously \nmonitor and improve the care provided to their patients. However, CMS cannot provide guidance on data, \nanalysis, or reports from software or data benchmarking from other sources such as software vendors or data \nbenchmarking companies. \n\nQUALITY EPISODES \n\nQuality episodes are used in the calculation of the quality measures. Quality episodes are not the same as \ncertification periods or Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) payment periods. A quality episode begins with \neither a Start of Care or Resumption of Care assessment and ends with a Transfer, Death at home, or Discharge \nassessment. A quality episode does not include Recertification (follow-up) or Other Follow-up assessments and \nmay span payment periods. \n\nA quality episode is measured from: \n\n\u2022  Start of Care to the Transfer OR \n\n\u2022  Start of Care to the Death at Home OR \n\n\u2022  Start of Care to the Discharge", "type": "Document"}}
