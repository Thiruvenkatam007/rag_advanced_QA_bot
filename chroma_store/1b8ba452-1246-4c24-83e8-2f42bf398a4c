If \nthe clinician determines that this observation is adequate, code based on the type and amount of assistance \nrequired to complete the shower/bathing activity. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the patient cannot bathe their entire body because of a medical condition (e.g. cast or a non-removable \ndressing), then code Shower/bathe self, based on the type and amount of assistance needed to complete the \nactivity. \n\nExamples \n\n1. During SOC/ROC functional assessment, the patient states they prefer to bathe themself rather than \ndepending on helpers or their spouse to perform this activity. The clinician assesses the patient\u2019s \nSOC/ROC performance for Shower/bathe self, and determines the helper performs more than half the \neffort.  \no  Coding: GG0130E, Shower/bathe self, SOC Performance would be coded 02, Substantial/maximal \n\nassistance. \n\no  Rationale: At SOC/ROC assessment, the patient participates in the activity Shower/bathe self, but a \n\nhelper performs more than half the activity.  \n\nGG0130F Upper Body Dressing, GG0130G Lower Body Dressing, and \nGG0130H Putting on/Taking off Footwear \nThis section presents Coding Tips that are applicable for GG0130F \u2013 Upper body dressing, GG0130G \u2013 Lower \nbody dressing, and GG0130H \u2013 Putting on/taking off footwear.
