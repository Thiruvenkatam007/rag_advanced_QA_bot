The fall may be \nwitnessed, reported by the patient or an observer, or identified when a patient \nis found on the floor or ground. Falls are not a result of an overwhelming \nexternal force (e.g., a patient pushes another patient).  \n\n\u2022  An intercepted fall is considered a fall. An intercepted fall occurs when the \n\npatient would have fallen if they had not caught themselves or had not been \nintercepted by another person. However, an anticipated loss of balance \nresulting from a supervised therapeutic intervention where the patient\u2019s \nbalance is being intentionally challenged during alliance training is not \nconsidered a fall. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Transfer \n\n\u2022  Death at home \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nInterview the patient and/or caregiver, review the home health clinical record and any other relevant clinical \ndocumentation, such as incident reports or fall logs. \n\nInclude all falls since the most recent SOC/ROC, regardless of where the fall occurred. \n\nCoding Instructions \n\n\u2022  Code 0, No, if the patient has not had any falls since the most recent SOC/ROC. \n\n\u2022  Code 1, Yes, if the patient has fallen since the most recent SOC/ROC and continue to J1900.
