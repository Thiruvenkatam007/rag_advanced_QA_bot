When a person strays, you \n\nshould gently guide the conversation back to the topic. \no  Example: Say, \u201cThat\u2019s interesting, now I need to know...\u201d; \u201cLet\u2019s get back to...\u201d; \u201cI understand, can you \n\ntell me about....\u201d \n\n\u2022  Validate your understanding of what the patient is saying by asking for clarification. \n\no  Example: Say, \u201cI think I hear you saying that...\u201d; \u201cLet\u2019s see if I understood you correctly.\u201d; \u201cYou said.... \n\nIs that right?\u201d \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the patient has difficulty selecting a frequency response, start by offering a single frequency response and \nfollow with a sequence of more specific questions. This is known as unfolding. \no  Example: Say, \u201cWould you say [name symptom] bothered you more than half the days in the past 2 \n\nweeks?\u201d \n\u00ad  If the patient says \u201cyes,\u201d show the cue card and ask whether it bothered them nearly every day (12-14 \n\ndays) or on half or more of the days (7-11 days). \n\n\u00ad  If the patient says \u201cno,\u201d show the cue card and ask whether it bothered them several days (26 days) or \n\nnever or 1 day (0-1 day). \n\n\u2022  Noncommittal responses such as \u201cnot really\u201d should be explored. Patients may be reluctant to report \n\nsymptoms and should be gently encouraged to tell you if the symptom bothered them, even if it was only \nsome of the time. This is known as probing. Probe by asking neutral or nondirective questions such as: \no  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \no  \u201cTell me what you have in mind.\u201d \no  \u201cTell me more about that.\u201d \no  \u201cPlease be more specific.\u201d \no  \u201cGive me an example.\u201d", "type": "Document"}}
