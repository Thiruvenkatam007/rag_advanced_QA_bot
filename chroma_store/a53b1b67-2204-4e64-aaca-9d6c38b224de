Relevant answers do not have to be correct, but need to be related to \nthe question.  \n\nItem Rationale \n\n\u2022  Direct or performance-based testing of cognitive function decreases the chance of incorrect labeling of \n\ncognitive ability and improves detection of delirium. \n\n\u2022  Cognitively intact patients may appear to be cognitively impaired because of a language barrier, hearing \n\nimpairment, or lack of social interaction. \n\n\u2022  Some patients may appear to be more cognitively intact than they actually are. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf cognitive impairment is incorrectly diagnosed or missed, appropriate communication, worthwhile activities \nand therapies may not be offered. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n59 \n\n![C0400.Recall\nEnterCode\nAskpatient:Let'sgo backtoan earlierquesbion.What were those threewordsthatIoskedyou torepeat?\nIf unable toremembera word,give cue[something to wear;a color;apiece of furniture)for that word\nA.\nAble torecall\"sock\"\n0.No-couldnotrecall\n1.\nYes,after cueing(\"something to wear\")\n2.Yes,no cue required\nEnter Code\nB.\nAble to recall \u201cblue\n0.\nNo-couldnot recall\n1.\nYes,after cueing (\"a color\")\n2.Yes,no cue required\nEnter Code\nC\nAble to recall \"bed\"\n0.No-couldnotrecall\n1.\nYes,aftercueing(\"apieceof furmiture\")\n2.\nYes,no cuerequired\nC05oo.Blivs Summary Score\nEnterCode\nAdd scoresfor questions C0200-C0400 and fill in total score(00-15)\nEnter99 ifthepatientwasunabletocompletetheinterview](#)\n\fChapter 3 \n\n\u2022  Discharge from Agency \n\nSection C: Cognitive Patterns \n\nBasic Interview Instructions for BIMS (C0200-C0500)", "type": "Document"}}
