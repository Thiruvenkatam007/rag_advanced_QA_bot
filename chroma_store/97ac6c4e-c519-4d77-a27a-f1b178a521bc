The patient had a stroke and needs to step up and down one step to enter and exit their home. At SOC, the \n\npatient\u2019s daughter is observed providing needed verbal cueing as the patient uses their quad cane to aid their \nbalance in stepping up and back down one step. No physical assistance was required. \no  Coding: GG0170M, 1 step would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. \no  Rationale: The patient needs only verbal cueing to complete the activity of stepping up and down one \n\nstep. \n\nGG0170N 4 steps \n\nDEFINITION \n\n4 STEPS \nThe ability to go up and down four steps with or without a rail. \n\nIf Discharge performance is coded 07, 09, 10, or 88, skip to GG0170P, Picking up object. \n\nCoding Tips \n\nAssess the patient going up and down 4 steps.  \n\nExamples \n\n1.  At SOC, the patient has lower body weakness, and the physical therapist provides light touching assistance \n\nwhen they ascend 4 steps. While descending 4 steps, the physical therapist faces the patient and descends the \nstairs providing trunk support, with one hand on the patient\u2019s hip and the other holding the gait belt, as the \npatient holds the stair railing. \no  Coding: GG0170N, 4 steps would be coded 03, Partial/moderate assistance. \no  Rationale: The therapist provides touching assistance as the patient ascends 4 steps. The therapist \n\nprovides trunk support when they descend the 4 steps, providing less than half the effort to complete the \nactivity. The patient requires partial/moderate assistance to go up and down 4 steps. \n\nGG0170O 12 steps \n\nDEFINITION \n\n12 STEPS \nThe ability to go up and down 12 steps with or without a rail. \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022  Assess the patient going up and down 12 steps. \n\n\u2022", "type": "Document"}}
