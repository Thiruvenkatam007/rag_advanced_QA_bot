Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be\nused for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a\npreviously healed pressure ulcer.\n\n\u2022 Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was\n\npreviously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it\nshould continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed.\n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n194\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection M: Skin Conditions \n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nIf the patient has been in an inpatient setting for some time, it is conceivable that the wound has already started\nto granulate, thus making it challenging to know the highest numerical stage of the wound. The\n\nclinician should make every effort to contact previous providers (including the patient\u2019s physician) to\ndetermine the highest numerical stage of the pressure ulcer.\n\n\u2022 The general standard of practice for patients starting or resuming care is that patient assessments are\n\ncompleted as close to the actual time of the SOC/ROC as possible. For example, if a pressure ulcer/injury that\nis identified on the SOC date increases in numerical stage within the assessment timeframe, the stage of the\npressure ulcer/injury at the first skin assessment completed would be reported in M1311X1 at the SOC.\no When the assessing clinician is unable to complete a full skin assessment at the first visit, the assessing\n\nclinician may collaborate with a second clinician who completes the first clinical skin assessment, within\nthe assessment timeframe.\n\n\u2022 Stage 2 Pressure Ulcers", "type": "Document"}}
