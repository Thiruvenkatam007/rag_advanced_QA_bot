The patient\u2019s referral information indicates that they were discharged from an acute care facility following an \ninpatient stay for bacterial pneumonia that required placement of a tracheostomy. At the start of care, the \npatient requires intermittent oxygen and assistance with trach care. Their tracheal suctioning needs are PRN. \nThe patient has intermittent desaturations due to mucus plugging that have required use of a tracheostomy \nmask at a FiO2 of greater than 40% intermittently. The patient has orders for 1 more week of IV antibiotics, \nwhich are being delivered via a PICC line. \no  Coding: Check boxes O0110C1 (Oxygen Therapy), O0110C3 (Intermittent), and O0110C4 (High \n\nconcentration), O0100D1 (Suctioning) and O0110D3 (As Needed), O0110E1 (Tracheostomy Care), \nO0110H1 (IV Medications) and O0110H3 (Antibiotics), and O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 \n(Central). \n\no  Rationale: The patient is receiving intermittent oxygen, high-concentration oxygen delivery, as needed \n\nsuctioning, tracheostomy care, and IV antibiotics via a PICC line at start of care. \n\n2.  A patient has advanced prostate cancer and is receiving radiation and oral chemotherapy medication to treat \nthe prostate cancer. They are being admitted today, following an inpatient stay for an acute pulmonary \nembolism. Their discharge orders include enoxaparin subcutaneously for continued anticoagulation. The \npatient does not have orders for other IV medications but still has a port in place. \no  Coding: Check boxes O0110A1 (Chemotherapy), O0110A3 (Chemotherapy, Oral), O0110B1 \n\n(Radiation), and O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 (Central). \n\no  Rationale: O0110H4 (Anticoagulation) is not checked because enoxaparin is administered", "type": "Document"}}
