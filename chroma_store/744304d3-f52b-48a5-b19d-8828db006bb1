If the pressure ulcer/injury was \n\npreviously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it \nshould continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. \n\n\u2022  Recognize that although Stage 1 pressure injuries are closed (intact skin), they would not be considered \n\nhealed. \n\nCoding Instructions \n\n\u2022  Enter the number of Stage 1 pressure injuries present at the first skin assessment completed at the \n\nSOC/ROC. \n\n\u2022  Dash is not a valid response for this item. \n\nM1324: Stage of Most Problematic Unhealed Pressure Ulcer/Injury that is Stageable \n\nItem Intent", "type": "Document"}}
