Even though the patient\u2019s port is not being accessed currently, they still \nhave one and therefore O0110O1 (IV Access) and O0110O4 (Central) should be checked. The patient is \nalso receiving oral chemotherapy and radiation so O0110A1 (Chemotherapy), O0110A3 (oral), and \nO0110B1 (Radiation) should be selected. \n\n3.  A patient has multiple myeloma and was discharged from an acute hospitalization after a pathologic vertebral \nfracture with significant pain. On admission to home health, referral documentation and physician orders \ninclude palliative radiation, lenalidomide orally for chemotherapy, and notes that frequent transfusions are \nrequired not related to the chemotherapy. They have a port for pamidronate infusions due to hypercalcemia. \no  Coding: Check boxes O0110A1 (Chemotherapy), O0110A3 (Oral), and O0110B1 (Radiation), O0110I1 \n(Transfusions), O0110H1 (IV Medications) and O0110H10 (Other) and O0110O1 (IV Access) and \nO0110O4 (Central). \n\no  Rationale: The patient is receiving oral chemotherapy (lenalidomide), radiation, transfusions, an IV \n\nmedication (pamidronate), which falls under \u201cother\u201d IV medications, and has a port. The transfusions are \nnoted to not be related to chemotherapy, and as such should be coded separately. \n\n4.  During the home health start of care assessment, the assessing clinician learns that a patient has sleep apnea \n\nand requires a CPAP device to be worn when sleeping. The patient\u2019s spouse sets up the humidifier element of \nthe CPAP and the patient puts on the CPAP mask prior to falling asleep. \no  Coding: Check boxes O0110G1 (Non-invasive Mechanical Ventilator) and O0110G3 (CPAP). \no  Rationale: The patient is able to breathe on their own and wears the CPAP mask when sleeping to \n\nmanage the sleep apnea.", "type": "Document"}}
