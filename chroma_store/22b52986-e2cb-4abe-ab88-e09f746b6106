The patient had bilateral below the knee amputations 3 years ago, and prior to this home health admission for \npressure ulcer care and initiation of prostheses use, they used a wheelchair and did not walk. At SOC, the \npatient does not use prosthetic devices and only uses a wheelchair for mobility.  \no  Coding: GG0170I, Walk 10 feet SOC Performance would be coded 09, Not applicable. \no  Rationale: When assessing the patient for GG0170I, Walk 10 feet, consider the patient\u2019s status \nprior to the current illness, exacerbation, or injury. Use code 09, Not applicable, because the \npatient could not perform the activity of walking at SOC and did not perform the activity of \nwalking prior to the most recent illness, exacerbation, or injury (the pressure ulcer).  \n\nGG0170J Walk 50 feet with two turns \n\nDEFINITION \n\nWALK 50 FEET WITH TWO TURNS \nOnce standing, the ability to walk 50 feet and make two turns. \n\nCoding Tips", "type": "Document"}}
