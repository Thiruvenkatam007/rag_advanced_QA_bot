Outcome of care measures are one \ntool for examining changes in patient condition or functioning that may be impacted by home health care services. \nThus, a change in the patient\u2019s environment, such as the provision of a walker or handrails in the patient\u2019s \nresidence, is not considered an outcome according to this definition\u2014such changes are services or processes of \ncare. \n\nThe definition of an outcome does not include a presumed direction; therefore, any deviation (or non-deviation) in \nhealth status between the initial time point and the follow-up time point constitutes an outcome. For example, did \nthe patient\u2019s ability to walk and move around improve by the time they finished working with the home health \nagency? A rate of 88% for that quality measure means that 88% of the time, the agency improved their patients\u2019 \nability to walk and move around. \n\nAn end-result outcome is a change in patient health status, such as physiologic, functional, cognitive, emotional, \nor behavioral health, between two or more time points. Examples of end-result outcome quality measures are \nImprovement in Management of Oral Medications and Stabilization in Bathing. For example, did the patient\u2019s \nability to manage their oral medications improve by the time they finished working with the home health agency? \nA rate of 80% for that quality measure means that 80% of the time, the patients\u2019 ability to manage their oral \nmedications improved from the start to the end of their home care episode.", "type": "Document"}}
