Each section begins with a brief \nintroduction describing the items found in the section. \nThe sources of information clinicians use to respond to \nitems are now located in the first bullet under \nResponse-Specific Instructions, and the OASIS-D \nSection \u201cData Sources/Resources\u201d has been \nremoved. Dash language has been added to each \nitem indicating whether a Dash is an acceptable \nresponse or not. General formatting and organization \nchanges have been made to improve clarity and \nremove redundancies. \n\nThroughout this chapter, the sections of OASIS-E are \npresented using a standard format for ease of review by \nHH staff. The layout and text color for headings varies \nfrom OASIS-D. Item-specific guidance includes additional \nheadings to convey information, for example, Coding \nInstructions, Coding Tips and Examples where \nappropriate. The order of information for all items in each \nsection of the OASIS-E is presented as follows. \n\nM0030.
