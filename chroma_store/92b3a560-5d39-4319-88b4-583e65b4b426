At SOC, the patient is recovering from a stroke resulting in motor issues and poor endurance. The patient\u2019s \n\nhome has 12 stairs, with a railing, and they need to use these stairs to enter and exit their home.

The patient is returning home after a hip replacement. They are restricted from stair climbing until they are \n\nseen for their follow-up MD appointment in one week. Just prior to their surgery, they climbed a flight of 12 \nstairs with stand-by assistance from a helper. \no  Coding: GG0170O, 12 steps would be coded 88, Not attempted due to medical condition or safety \n\nconcerns. \n\no  Rationale: At the SOC, the patient is unable to complete the activity of going up and down 12 steps due \nto a temporary physician-ordered activity restriction. Prior to the recent surgery, the patient was able to \ncomplete that activity with assistance, so code 88 is appropriate. \n\nGG0170P Picking up object \n\nDEFINITION", "type": "Document"}}
