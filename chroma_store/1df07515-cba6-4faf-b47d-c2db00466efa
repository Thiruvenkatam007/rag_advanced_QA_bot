In addition to direct observation, coding can be \ndetermined based on patient/caregiver report, collaboration with other agency staff, or assessment of similar \nactivities. \n\n\u2022  The activities of GG0170B - Sit to lying and GG0170C - Lying to sitting on side of bed are two separate \n\nactivities that are not assessed as part of GG0170E \u2013 Chair/Bed to Chair Transfer. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The patient had a stroke and uses a wheelchair for mobility. When they get out of bed at SOC, their daughter \nmoves the wheelchair into the correct position and locks the brakes so that the patient can transfer into the \nwheelchair safely. The patient transfers into the wheelchair by themself without the need for supervision or \nassistance during the transfer. The family reports that the patient does transfer safely from bed to wheelchair \nand back without the need for supervision, once the wheelchair is placed and locked.  \no  Coding: GG0170E, Chair/bed-to-chair transfer, SOC Performance would be coded 05, Setup or cleanup \n\nassistance. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n144\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection H: Bladder and Bowel", "type": "Document"}}
