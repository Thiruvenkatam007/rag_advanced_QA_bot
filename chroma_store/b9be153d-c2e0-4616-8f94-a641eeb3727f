The patient has right-side upper extremity weakness as a result of a stroke and has received therapy to relearn \nhow to dress their upper body. During the day, they require a helper to place clothing next to the bedside. The \npatient can then use compensatory strategies to put on their bra and top without any assistance. At night they \nremove their top and bra independently and put the clothes on the nightstand and the helper puts them away. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n138\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection H: Bladder and Bowel \n\no  Coding: GG0130F would be coded 05, Setup or clean-up assistance. \no  Rationale: The patient dresses and undresses their upper body and requires a helper only to retrieve and \n\nput away their clothing; that is, setting-up the clothing for patient use.
