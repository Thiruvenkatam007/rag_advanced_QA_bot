In this example, this \npatient had two quality episodes. The first quality episode began with the start of care on 1/1/23 and ended with \nthe transfer to an inpatient facility on 1/15/25. The second quality episode began with the resumption of care on \n1/20/23 and ended with the discharge on 2/1/25. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n274\n\fAppendix F \n\n                                                       OASIS and Quality Improvement \n\nCALCULATING QUALITY MEASURES \n\nMeasuring quality first begins at the patient-level. Outcome measures indicate the change in patient status from \none point in time to another point in time. For the OASIS-based quality measures, we use the OASIS items for \nthis calculation. To calculate quality measures, we also need to understand the measure definition for each \nindividual measure. The Quality Measure Tables found on the CMS Home Health Quality Reporting Program \nwebsite include information on the measure numerator, denominator, and measure exclusions for each home \nhealth quality measure (https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-\nInstruments/HomeHealthQualityInits). \n\nEXAMPLE: IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPNEA \n\nMeasure Definition: The \u201cImprovement in Dyspnea\u201d quality measure is the \u201cPercentage of home health quality \nepisodes during which the patient became less short of breath or dyspneic.\u201d", "type": "Document"}}
