The standardized home health quality process measures focus on high-risk, high-volume, problem-prone \nareas for home health care. These include measures pertaining to all or most home care patients, such as timeliness \nof home care admission/resumption of care and immunization rates. \n\nProcess items represent actions taken by home health care providers that are designed to favorably impact patient \noutcomes. An example of a process measure is the percentage of home health quality episodes during which \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n272\n\fAppendix F \n\n                                                       OASIS and Quality Improvement \n\npatients received the influenza immunization for the current flu season. An agency rate of 72% for that measure \nmeans that the agency\u2019s process of caring for patients included the recommended practice in 72% of the included \nquality episodes. The processes of care items in OASIS have been carefully developed to represent \u201cevidence-\nbased\u201d practice. \n\nMEASURE EXCLUSIONS FOR PROCESS MEASURES \n\nMost OASIS-based process measures have measure-specific exclusions. Exclusions are specific to each measure. \nFor example, the process measure of \u201cInfluenza Immunization Received for Current Flu Season\u201d excludes quality \nepisodes in which no care was provided during October 1\u2013March 31, or the patient died, or the patient does not \nmeet age/condition guidelines for influenza vaccine. Quality episodes that are excluded are not counted favorably \nor unfavorably toward the measure calculation. \n\nExample \u2013 Process Measures \n\nQuality Measure \nName \n\nConsumer Language (on \nHome Health Compare)", "type": "Document"}}
