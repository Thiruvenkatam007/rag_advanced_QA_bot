Responses can be interpreted as follows: \no  Major Depressive Syndrome is suggested if\u2014of the 9 items\u20145 or more items are identified at a frequency \n\nof half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look-back period. \n\no  Minor Depressive Syndrome is suggested if, of the 9 items, (1) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, (2) \ntrouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much, or (3) feeling tired or having little energy are \nidentified at a frequency of half or more of the days (7-11 days) during the look-back period. \no  In addition, PHQ-2 to 9 Total Severity Score can be used to track changes in severity over time. \no  Total Severity Score can be interpreted as follows: \n\n\u00ad  0-4: Minimal depression \n\u00ad  5-9: Mild depression \n\u00ad  10-14: Moderate depression \n\u00ad  15-19: Moderately severe depression \n\u00ad  20-27: Severe depression \n\nScoring Rules: Patient Mood Interview Total Severity Score D0160 \n\nIf only the PHQ-2 is completed because both D0150A2 and D0150B2 are coded 0 or 1, add the numeric \nscores from these two frequency items and enter the value in D0160. \n\nIf items D0150C through D0150I were asked, calculate the Total Severity Score: \n\n\u2022 \n\nItem D0160 is used to store the total severity score for the Patient Mood Interview.
