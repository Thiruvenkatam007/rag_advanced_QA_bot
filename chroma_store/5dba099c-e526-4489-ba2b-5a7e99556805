Motorized \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf at the time of assessment, the patient uses both a manual and a motorized wheelchair or scooter to complete \nthe Wheel 150 feet activity, code the activity based on the type of wheelchair/scooter with which the patient \nrequires the most assistance. \n\nIf the patient\u2019s environment does not accommodate wheelchair/scooter use of 150 feet without turns, but the \npatient demonstrates the ability to mobilize the wheelchair/scooter with or without assistance 150 feet with \nturns without jeopardizing the patient\u2019s safety, code using the 6-point scale. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The patient uses a below-the-knee prosthetic limb. The patient has peripheral neuropathy and limited vision \ndue to complications of diabetes. Via observation and patient report, the assessing clinician determines that \nthe patient\u2019s usual performance is that a helper is needed to provide verbal cues for safety due to vision \ndeficits, and the patient mobilizes their manual wheelchair a distance of 150 feet within their home. \no  Coding: GG0170S, Wheel 150 feet would be coded 04, Supervision or touching assistance. GG0170SS, \n\nIndicate the type of wheelchair/scooter used would be coded 1, Manual. \n\no  Rationale: Using a manual wheelchair, the patient requires the helper to provide verbal cues for their \n\nsafety as they propel themself in their wheelchair for 150 feet. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n155\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection H: Bladder and Bowel \n\nSECTION H: BLADDER AND BOWEL \nIntroduction \nThe items in this section assess bowel and bladder function to identify situations that could impact patient health \nstatus or their plan of care. \n\nM1600: Has this patient been treated for a Urinary Tract Infection in the past 14 days?", "type": "Document"}}
