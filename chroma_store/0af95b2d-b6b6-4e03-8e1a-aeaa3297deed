The term \u201cquality\u201d in healthcare may have many different meanings. However, standard \ndefinitions are required to be able to measure quality and to then improve quality. The OASIS-based quality \nmeasures provide the home health industry with a framework for defining quality in terms of what matters to a \npatient and their caregivers. The home health quality measures have included many measures of activities of daily \nliving (ADLs), patient status, and home health agency care processes. These include the measures of \n\u201cImprovement in Ambulation- Locomotion\u201d, \u201cStabilization in Grooming,\u201d \u201cImprovement in Bed Transferring,\u201d \netc. These measures are important to patients as they symbolize quality of life and independence in a home \nsetting. Quality measures also benefit clinicians by promoting best practice interventions.

Through the internet Quality Improvement and \nEvaluation System (iQIES) reports, agencies can compare, or benchmark, their current performance to their prior \nperformance on each quality measure and compare their performance to a national reference rate. \n\nOUTCOME AND PROCESS MEASURES \n\nThe initial OASIS-based quality measures were risk adjusted outcome measures. Shortly after the 2010 \nimplementation of OASIS-C, agencies were introduced to the first standardized process measures which were \nderived from OASIS data. \n\nOUTCOME MEASURES", "type": "Document"}}
