This includes the use of any new or \n\npreviously utilized assistive device(s) or equipment. Use of a device or equipment may result in the patient \nneeding less assistance from a helper. \n\n\u2022  The patient may be assessed based on the first use of an assistive device or equipment that has not been \n\npreviously used. The clinician would provide assistance, as needed, in order for the patient to complete the \nactivity safely, and code based on the type and amount of assistance required, prior to the benefit of services \nprovided by your agency staff. \n\n\u2022  \u201cPrior to the benefit of services\u201d means prior to provision of any care by your agency staff that would result in \n\nmore independent coding. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIntroducing a new device should not automatically be considered as \u201cproviding a service\u201d. Whether a device \nused during the clinical assessment is new to the patient or not, use clinical judgment to code based on the \ntype and amount of assistance that is required for the patient to complete the activity prior to the benefit of \nservices provided by your agency staff. \n\n\u2022  CMS does not provide an exhaustive list of assistive devices that may be used when coding self-care and \n\nmobility performance. Clinical assessments may include any device or equipment (including a stair lift) that \nthe patient can use to allow them to safely complete the activity as independently as possible. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the only help a patient needs to complete an activity is for a helper to retrieve an assistive device or adaptive \nequipment that is required for safe completion of the activity, such as a cane for walking, or a tub bench for \nbathing, before or after the activity, then enter code 05, Setup, or clean-up assistance. \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions for SOC/ROC Performance \n\nDEFINITION", "type": "Document"}}
