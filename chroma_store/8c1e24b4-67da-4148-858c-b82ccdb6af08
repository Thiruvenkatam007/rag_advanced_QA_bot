It may be either a \nsecondary effect of a medication that is usually undesirable and different from the \ntherapeutic effect of the medication or any response to a medication that is noxious and \nunintended and occurs in doses for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or treatment. The term \u201cside \neffect\u201d is often used interchangeably with ADR. However, side effects are but one of five \nADR categories, the others being: hypersensitivity, idiosyncratic response, toxic \nreactions, and adverse medication interactions. A side effect is an expected, well-known \nreaction that occurs with a predictable frequency and may or may not constitute an \nadverse consequence. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care  \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  Data sources/resources include medical records received from facilities where the patient received health care, \n\nthe patient\u2019s most recent history and physical, transfer documents, discharge summaries, medication \nlists/records, clinical progress notes, and other resources as available. \no  Discussions (including with the acute care hospital, other staff and clinicians, the patient, and the patient\u2019s \n\nfamily/significant other) may supplement and/or clarify the information gleaned from the patient\u2019s \nmedical records. \n\nDEFINITION", "type": "Document"}}
