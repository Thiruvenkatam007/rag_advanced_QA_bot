Height and weight to calculate body mass, nutritional approaches, and \nassessment of the ability to eat, chew and swallow food. \n\nM1060: Height and Weight \n\nItem Intent \n\nThese items support calculation of the patient\u2019s body mass index (BMI) using the patient\u2019s height and weight. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\nWhenever possible, a current height and weight should be obtained by the agency as part of the SOC/ROC \nassessment. \n\n\u2022  M1060A Height \n\no  Measure height in accordance with the agency\u2019s policies and procedures. \no  Measure and record the patient\u2019s height to the nearest whole inch. \no  Use mathematical rounding (i.e., if height measurement is X.5 inches or greater, round height upward to \nthe nearest whole inch. If height measurement number is X.1 to X.4 inches, round down to the nearest \nwhole inch). For example, a height of 62.5 inches would be rounded to 63 inches, and a height of 62.4 \ninches would be rounded to 62 inches. \n\no  Only enter a height that has been directly measured by agency staff. Do not enter a height that is self-\n\nreported or derived from documentation from another provider setting. \n\n\u2022  M1060B Weight \n\no  Weight should be measured in accordance with the agency\u2019s policies and procedures. \no  Measure and record the patient\u2019s weight in pounds. \no  Use mathematical rounding (e.g., if weight is X.5 pounds [lbs.] or more, round weight upward to the \n\nnearest whole pound. If weight is X.1 to X.4 lbs., round down to the nearest whole pound). For example, a \nweight of 152.5 lbs. would be rounded to 153 lbs. and a weight of 152.4 lbs. would be rounded to 152 lbs. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n180", "type": "Document"}}
