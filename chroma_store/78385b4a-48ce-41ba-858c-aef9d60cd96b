Alternatively, a coding specialist in the agency may \nenter the actual numeric ICD-10-CM codes in Column 2, as long as the assessing clinician has determined the \nprimary and other diagnoses in Column 1. \n\n\u2022  Assessing the degree of symptom control includes but is not limited to review of presenting signs and \nReporting the Symptom Control Rating in Column 2 \n\nsymptoms, type and number of medications, frequency of treatment readjustments, and frequency of contact \nwith health care providers. \no  Inquire about the degree to which each condition limits daily activities. \no  Assess the patient to determine if symptoms are controlled by current treatments. \no  Clarify which diagnoses/symptoms have been poorly controlled in the recent past. \no  Note that the rating for symptom control in Column 2 should not be used to determine the sequencing of \nthe diagnoses listed in Column 1. These are separate items, and the sequencing may not coincide.  \n\no  Do not assign a symptom control rating if the diagnosis code is a V, W, X, Y, or Z code. \n\nCoding Instructions", "type": "Document"}}
