Category cues should be used only after the patient \nis unable to recall one or more of the three words. \n\n\u2022  Allow up to 5 seconds after category cueing for each missed word to be recalled. \n\nCoding Instructions \n\nFor each of the three words the patient is asked to remember: \n\n\u2022  Code 0, No\u2014could not recall, if the patient cannot recall the word even after being given the category cue \n\nor if the patient responds with a nonsensical answer or chooses not to answer the item. \n\n\u2022  Code 1, Yes, after cueing, if the patient requires the category cue to remember the word. \n\n\u2022  Code 2, Yes, no cue required, if the patient correctly remembers the word spontaneously without cueing. \n\n\u2022  Dash is a valid response for this item. \n\no  A dash indicates \u201cno information.\u201d CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. \n\nCoding Tips \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf on the first try (without cueing), the patient names multiple items in a category, one of which is correct, \nthey should be coded as correct for that item. \n\nIf, however, the assessing clinician gives the patient the cue and the patient then names multiple items in that \ncategory, the item is coded as could not recall, even if the correct item was in the list. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The patient is asked to recall the three words that were initially presented. The patient chooses not to answer \n\nthe question and states, \u201cI\u2019m tired, and I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u201d \no  Coding: C0400A-C0400C would be coded 0, No\u2014could not recall, could not recall for each of the three \n\nwords. \n\no  Rationale: Choosing not to answer a question often indicates an inability to answer the question, so \n\nrefusals are coded 0, No\u2014could not recall. This is the most accurate way to score cognitive function, \neven though, on occasion, patients might choose not to answer for other reasons. \n\n2.  The patient is asked to recall the three words. The patient replies, \u201cSocks, shoes, and bed.\u201d The examiner then", "type": "Document"}}
