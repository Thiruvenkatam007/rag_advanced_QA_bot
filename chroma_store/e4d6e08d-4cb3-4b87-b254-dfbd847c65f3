If discharge assessment, \ncomplete as close to the time of discharge as possible.  \n\n\u2022  Observe patient behavior during the assessment for the signs and symptoms of delirium. \n\n\u2022  Review medical record documentation and consult with other staff, family members/caregivers and others in a \n\nposition to determine the patient\u2019s baseline status compared to status on the day of assessment. \n\n\u2022  Consider all relevant information and use clinical judgment to determine if an acute change in mental status \n\nhas occurred. \n\nScoring Guide \n\nCoding Instructions for C1310A, Acute Mental Status Change \n\n\u2022  Code 0, No, if there is no evidence of acute mental status change from the patient\u2019s baseline. \n\n\u2022  Code 1, Yes, if patient has an alteration in mental status observed or reported or identified that represents an \n\nacute change from baseline. \n\n\u2022  Dash is a valid response for this item. \n\no  A dash indicates \u201cno information.\u201d CMS expects dash use to be a rare occurrence. \n\nCoding Tips for C1310A, Acute Mental Status Change \n\nAt discharge, compare the patient\u2019s current mental status to their baseline mental status (prior to the discharge \nassessment time period under consideration). \n\nExamples \n\n1.  Patient was admitted to home health. The family reports that the patient was alert and oriented prior to the day \n\nof assessment. During the BIMS interview and assessment, the patient is lethargic and incoherent. \no  Coding: C1310A would be coded 1, Yes. \no  Rationale: There is an acute change of the patient\u2019s mental status from alert and oriented (family report \n\nprior to admission) to lethargic and incoherent during the start of care assessment.", "type": "Document"}}
