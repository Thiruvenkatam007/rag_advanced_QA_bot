CMS is \nremoving two items, M0110 Episode Timing and M2200 \nTherapy Need that are no longer used in the HH Quality \nReporting Program (QRP) or for other CMS purposes. The \nGG0130 Self Care and GG0170 Mobility items are revised \nto remove the Discharge Goals, due to the removal of the \nApplication of Percent of Long-Term Care Hospital (LTCH) \nPatients with an Admission and Discharge Functional \nAssessment and a Care Plan that Addresses Function \n(Application of Functional Assessment/Care Plan), also \nfinalized in the CY2024 HH final rule. One item, D0150 \nPatient Health Questionnaire, is revised to clarify the \ninstructions.  \n\nPer the HH Conditions of Participation (CoPs), a registered \nnurse  (RN)  must  complete  the  initial  assessment  and \ncomprehensive  assessment \nfor \nMedicare patients, determine eligibility for the Medicare home \nhealth benefit, including homebound status, except:  \n\nincluding  OASIS,  and \n\nWhen SLP, PT, or OT is the only service ordered by the \nphysician or allowed practitioner who is responsible for the \nhome health plan of care, the initial assessment visit may \nbe made by the appropriate rehabilitation skilled \nprofessional.  \n\u2022 \n\nFor Medicare patients, an OT may complete the initial \nassessment when OT is ordered with another qualifying \nrehabilitation therapy service (SLP or PT) that \nestablishes program eligibility. \n\nWhen PT, SLP, or OT is the only service ordered by the \nphysician or allowed practitioner, a PT, SLP, or OT may \ncomplete the comprehensive assessment, and for \nMedicare patients, determine eligibility for the Medicare \nhome health benefit, including homebound status.  \n\nDescription of Change", "type": "Document"}}
