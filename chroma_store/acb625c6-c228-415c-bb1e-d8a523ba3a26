Code based on the type and amount of assistance required to perform the activity \nsafely. \n\n\u2022  When using patient or caregiver reports, it is expected that the patient and caregivers are reporting on the \n\npatient\u2019s status within the time period under consideration (e.g., reporting on the patient\u2019s ability to complete \nan activity within the past 24 hours). \n\n\u2022  For GG0130 and GG0170 the assessing clinician codes each activity based on the type and amount of \nassistance needed to complete the activity safely, not based on the availability of such assistance. \n\n\u2022  Assessment of the GG self-care and mobility items is based on the patient\u2019s ability to complete the activity \nwith or without assistance and/or a device. This is true regardless of whether the activity is being/will be \nroutinely performed (e.g., walking may be assessed for a patient who did/does/will use a wheelchair as their \nprimary mode of mobility, stair activities may be assessed for a patient not routinely accessing stairs). \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n129\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection GG: Functional Abilities \n\n\u2022  Refer to agency, Federal, and State policies and procedures to determine which agency staff members may \ncomplete an assessment.
