Examples of utilization outcomes include quality measures that \nidentify hospital admission, use of hospital emergency department services, and discharge to the community. \nUtilization measures were initially computed using only OASIS data; however, current, and potential future \nmeasures may be computed using Medicare FFS claims data. A complete list of quality measures and measure \ndescriptions are available on the CMS Home Health Quality Reporting Program website. \n\nMEASURE EXCLUSIONS FOR OUTCOME MEASURES \n\nSome patients are excluded from the improvement or the stabilization computations. Any patient whose status at \nstart (or resumption) of care is optimal for the health attribute under consideration is excluded from the \nimprovement computation. Such a case is excluded because the patient could not possibly show improvement, \nsince they are as \u201cgood\u201d as they can possibly be for this attribute. All the patients included in the improvement \ncomputation had the potential to show improvement; the percentage (and the actual number of cases) listed at the \nend of the bar actually did improve. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n271\n\fAppendix F \n\n                                                       OASIS and Quality Improvement \n\nLike exclusions from the improvement measures, some cases are excluded from the stabilization computation. \nAny patient whose status at start (or resumption) of care is at the most severely impaired level for the health \nattribute under consideration is excluded from the stabilization computation. This patient could not possibly show \nworsening, and therefore is excluded.", "type": "Document"}}
