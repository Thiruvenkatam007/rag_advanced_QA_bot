For some patients this may include assessing the type and amount of assistance \nneeded to complete clothing management and hygiene tasks after episodes of incontinence. If the patient \ncompletes a bowel toileting program in bed, code the item Toileting hygiene based on the patient\u2019s need for \nassistance for managing clothing and perineal cleansing. \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf the patient has an indwelling urinary catheter and has bowel movements, code the Toileting hygiene item \nbased on the type and amount of assistance needed by the patient when moving their bowels. This may \nnecessarily include the need to perform perineal hygiene to the indwelling urinary catheter site after the bowel \nmovement. \n\nIf a patient has an indwelling catheter, toileting hygiene includes perineal hygiene to the indwelling catheter \nsite, but not management of the equipment. \n\nIf a patient manages an ostomy, toileting hygiene includes wiping the opening of the ostomy or colostomy \nbag, but not management of the equipment. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The patient has a progressive neurological illness that affects their strength, coordination, and endurance. The \n\npatient prefers to use the bedside commode for as long as possible rather than using incontinence \nundergarments. The helper currently provides steadying assistance while the patient is standing so that the \npatient can pull down their underwear before sitting onto the bedside commode. After voiding, the patient \nwipes their perineal area, then requires the helper to support their trunk while the patient pulls up their \nunderwear.  \no  Coding: GG0130C, Toileting hygiene SOC/ROC Performance would be coded 03, Partial/moderate \n\nassistance.", "type": "Document"}}
