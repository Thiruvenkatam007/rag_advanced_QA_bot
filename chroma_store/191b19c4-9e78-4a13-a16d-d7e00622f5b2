If a clinician chooses to combine the assessment of multiple wheelchair activities use clinical \njudgment to determine the type and amount of assistance needed for each individual activity. \n\n\u2022  A helper can assist a patient to complete the wheelchair distance or make turns if required. When a patient is \nunable to wheel the entire distance themselves the activity can still be completed, and a performance code can \nbe determined based on the type and amount of assistance required from the helper to complete the entire \nactivity. \n\nGG0170R Wheel 50 feet with two turns, and GG0170RR Indicate the type of wheelchair or \nscooter used \n\nWHEEL 50 FEET WITH TWO TURNS \nOnce seated in wheelchair/scooter, the ability to wheel at least 50 feet and make two \nturns. \n\nDEFINITION \n\nIndicate the type of wheelchair or scooter used. \n\n1.

The turns may \noccur at any time during the 50-foot distance. The turns may be in the same direction (two 90-degree turns to \nthe right or two 90 -degree turns to the left) or may be in different directions (one 90-degree turn to the left \nand one 90-degree turn to the right). The 90-degree turn should occur at the person\u2019s ability level. \n\n\u2022 \n\nIf at the time of assessment, the patient uses both a manual and a motorized wheelchair or scooter to complete \nthe Wheel 50 feet with two turns activity, code the activity based on the type of wheelchair/scooter with \nwhich the patient requires the most assistance. \n\nExamples", "type": "Document"}}
