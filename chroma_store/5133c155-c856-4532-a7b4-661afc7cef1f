The clinician must consider what the patient is able to do \non the day of the assessment. If a patient does not require human assistance, but safely ambulates with a \nwalker in some areas of the home, and a cane in other areas (due to space limitations, distances, etc.), enter the \nresponse that reflects the device that best supports safe ambulation on all surfaces the patient routinely \nencounters. \n\nCoding Instructions \n\n\u2022  Code 2 or 3, if the patient requires human assistance (hands on, supervision and/or verbal cueing) to safely \n\nambulate, regardless of the need for an assistive device. Code 2 if the assistance required is intermittent. Code \n3 if the assistance required is continuous. \n\n\u2022  Code 2, if the patient is: \n\no  Able to safely ambulate without a device on a level surface, but requires minimal assistance on stairs, \n\nsteps, and uneven surfaces. \no  Able to safely ambulate with a walker in the hallway or living room, even if there are some \no  situations in the home where a cane provides adequate support as long as the patient does not require \n\ncontinuous human assistance. \n\n\u2022  Code 3, if a patient does not have a walking device but is clearly not safe walking alone, unless the patient is \n\nchairfast. \n\n\u2022  Code 4 or 5, if a patient: \n\no  Is unable to ambulate even with the use of assistive devices and/or continuous assistance. \no  Demonstrates or reports the ability to take one or two steps to complete a transfer but is otherwise unable \n\nto ambulate. \n\n\u2022  Dash is not a valid response for this item. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n116\n\fChapter 3", "type": "Document"}}
