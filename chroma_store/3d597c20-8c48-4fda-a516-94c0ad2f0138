Today, \nagencies may decide to use other quality improvement methodologies in addition to or in place of OBQI. \nExamples include Six Sigma, Lean Methodology, and PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act). \n\nAlthough agencies may choose not to use the original OBQI process, many of the steps within OBQI are relevant \nto home health quality improvement today. A cyclical and ongoing quality improvement process may include the \nfollowing steps: \n\n1.  Review Quality Measure Reports \n\n2.  Select Quality Measures\u2014for focused quality improvement activities \n\n3.  Investigate Care Processes (related to measures selected for quality improvement) \n\n4.  Develop a Plan of Action (a.k.a., Quality Improvement Plan)", "type": "Document"}}
