If the patient is unable to decide between 2 options, then the assessing clinician should code for the \noption with the higher frequency. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  Assessing clinician: \u201cOver the past 5 days, how often have you limited your day-to-day activities (excluding \n\nrehabilitation therapy sessions) because of pain?\u201d \n\nPatient: \u201cAlthough I have some pain in my back, I\u2019m still able to read, eat my meals, and take walks like I \nusually do.\u201d \no  Coding: J0530 would be coded 1, Rarely or not at all. \no  Rationale: The patient reports that pain has not limited participation in day-to-day activities. \n\n2.  Assessing clinician: \u201cOver the past 5 days, how often have you limited your day-to-day activities (excluding \n\nrehabilitation therapy sessions) because of pain?\u201d \n\nPatient: \u201cThe pain has made it hard to do pretty much anything. Even getting out of bed to brush my teeth \nhas been hard. I haven\u2019t been able to talk to my family because the pain is so bad. It\u2019s just constant. I\u2019d say \nit constantly limits what I do.\u201d \no  Coding: J0530 would be coded 4, Almost constantly. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n173\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status", "type": "Document"}}
