Only when enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the \nanatomic depth of soft tissue damage involved, can the stage of the wound be determined. \n\no Unstageable pressure ulcers due to eschar or slough would not be considered healed.\n\n\u2022 Unstageable: Deep Tissue Injury (DTI)\n\no Report in M1311F1 the number of unstageable pressure injuries presenting as deep tissue injury.\n\n\u00ad  Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones.\n\u00ad  Deep Tissue Injury (DTI), although closed (intact skin), would not be considered healed.\n\u00ad  A pressure ulcer/injury presenting with characteristics of a DTI is reported as a DTI unless full\n\nthickness tissue loss is present.
