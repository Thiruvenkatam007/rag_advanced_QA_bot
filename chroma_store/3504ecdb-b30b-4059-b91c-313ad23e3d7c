This includes patients who are learning how to self-mobilize using a wheelchair \nor scooter, those who require assistance from a helper to mobilize using a wheelchair/scooter, and those who \nrequire a helper to push them in a wheelchair. \n\n\u2022  Only Code 0, No, if at the time of the assessment the patient does not use a wheelchair or scooter under any \n\ncondition, Skip all remaining wheelchair questions.  \n\n\u2022  Code 1, yes, if the patient uses a wheelchair and/or scooter. \n\n\u2022  The responses for the gateway wheelchair item (GG0170Q1 and GG0170Q3) might not be the same on \n\nstart/resumption of care and discharge assessments. \no  For example, at SOC a patient may never have used a wheelchair before and is currently not using one \nunder any condition. GG0170Q at SOC is coded 0-No. During the episode, the patient does begin \ninstruction in wheelchair use, and at Discharge the patient is able to mobilize the manual chair for short \ndistances. GG0170Q at Discharge is coded 1-Yes. \n\nExamples \n\n1.
