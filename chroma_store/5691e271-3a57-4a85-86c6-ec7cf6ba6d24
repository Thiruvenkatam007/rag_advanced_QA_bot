In the event you cannot resolve your understanding of the \nOASIS item guidance by reviewing the OASIS Guidance Manual and/or the Q&A documents, consider \nsubmitting your question to the Home Health Quality Help Desk (a link to the OASIS Q&As and the email \naddress for the Home Health Quality Help Desk can be found in Appendix E. References and Resources). \n\n1.5.5.1 General OASIS Item Conventions \n\n1.  Understand the time period under consideration (look back) for each item. Report what is true on the day \nof assessment unless a different time period has been indicated in the item or related guidance. Day of \nassessment is defined as the 24 hours immediately preceding the home visit and the time spent by the \nclinician in the home. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n4\n\fChapter 1 \n\nOASIS Guidance Manual Introduction \n\n2.  For OASIS purposes, a quality episode must have a beginning (that is, an SOC or ROC assessment) and a \n\nconclusion (that is, a Transfer, Death at Home, or Discharge assessment) to be considered a complete quality \nepisode. \n\n3.  If the patient\u2019s ability or status varies on the day of the assessment, report what is true greater than 50% of \n\nthe time period under consideration, unless the item specifies differently. \n\n4.  Minimize the use of NA and Unknown responses. \n\n5.  Some items allow a dash response. A dash (\u2013) value indicates that no information is available.
