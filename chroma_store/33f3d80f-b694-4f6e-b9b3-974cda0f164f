A patient receives a paper copy of their medication list, receives education about their medications by the \n\nhome health nurse at discharge, and is notified that the home health patient portal is another means that the \npatient can obtain their discharge medication list. \no  Coding: Code Electronic Health Record (A), Verbal (C), and Paper-based (D) for A2124. \no  Rationale: The copy of the medication list is paper based (D). The information about the patient\u2019s \n\nmedication list was also communicated verbally by the nurse at the time of discharge (C). The patient portal \nuses the agency\u2019s EHR to provide access to the medication list (A). It is not necessary to confirm that the \npatient is a registered user of and accessed the patient portal to code EHR (A) as a route.", "type": "Document"}}
