Therefore, \nsupplements (whether taken with, in-between, or instead of meals) are only coded in K0520D, Therapeutic \nDiet when they are being taken as part of a therapeutic diet to manage problematic health conditions (e.g., \nsupplement for protein-calorie malnutrition). \no  Food elimination diets related to food allergies (e.g., peanut allergy) can be coded as a therapeutic diet. \n\nExamples for SOC/ROC: K0520A, Parenteral/IV feeding \n\n1.  A patient is admitted with orders for an antibiotic in 100 cc of normal saline via IV for symptoms of a urinary \ntract infection (UTI), fever, abnormal lab results (e.g., new pyuria, microscopic hematuria, urine culture with \ngrowth >105 colony forming units of a urinary pathogen), and documented inadequate fluid intake (i.e., \noutput of fluids far exceeds fluid intake) with signs and symptoms of dehydration. The plan of care is updated \nto include a hydration intervention to ensure adequate hydration. Documentation shows IV fluids are being \nadministered as part of the already identified need for additional hydration. \no  Coding: K0520A would be checked. The IV medication would be coded at IV Medications item \n\n(O0110H). \n\no  Rationale: The patient received 100 cc of IV fluid and there is supporting documentation that reflected an \n\nidentified need for additional fluid intake for hydration. \n\n2.  A patient is admitted and receiving an antibiotic in 100 cc of normal saline via IV. They have a UTI, no fever, \nand documented adequate fluid intake. The patient is placed on an oral hydration plan to maintain adequate \nhydration. \no  Coding: K0520A would NOT be checked.
