In this example, this quality measure excludes home health quality episodes for which the patient, \nat start/resumption of care, was not short of breath at any time, and also excludes quality episodes that end with \ninpatient facility transfer, death, or a discharge to a non-institutional/home hospice. Therefore, for this quality \nmeasure, all patients who at start of care or resumption of care are scored a \u201c0 \u2013 Patient is not short of breath\u201d on \nOASIS are excluded from this quality measure because the patient cannot improve. If the patient cannot improve, \nthen Improvement in Dyspnea is not computed. Quality episodes that are excluded are not counted favorably or \nunfavorably toward the quality measure calculation.", "type": "Document"}}
