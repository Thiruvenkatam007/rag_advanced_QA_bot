If a \n\nproxy is not able to provide a response, medical record documentation may be used. \n\no  If the response(s) is/are determined via proxy input and/or medical record documentation, check all boxes \n\nthat apply, including Code X - Patient unable to respond. \n\no  If the patient is unable to respond and no other resources (proxy input or medical record documentation) \n\nprovided the necessary information, code X \u2013 Patient unable to respond, only. \n\n\u2022  Code Y, Patient declines to respond, if the patient declines to respond. \n\no  In the cases where the patient declines to respond, code Y \u2013 Patient declines to respond, only. \no  If the patient declines to respond, do not code based on proxy input or medical record documentation to \n\ncomplete this item. \n\n\u2022  Code Z, None of the above, if the patient reports or it is determined from proxy or medical record \n\ndocumentation that none of the listed races apply to the patient. \n\n\u2022  Dash is not a valid response for this item. \n\nExamples \n\n1.
