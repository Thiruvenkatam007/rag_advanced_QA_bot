No issues identified, During the comprehensive assessment visit, the PT reviews all the patient\u2019s \n\nmedications and identifies no problems except that the patient\u2019s newly prescribed pain medication is not in the \nhome. The patient\u2019s child states they were only going to pick it up from the pharmacy if \u201cthe pain got bad \nenough.\u201d The PT reviews the physician\u2019s instructions for the new medication with the patient and their child; \nthey both agree the medication should be on hand, and to follow physician\u2019s instructions for administration. \nPrior to the PT leaving the home, the child went to the drugstore and returned with the medication. \no  Coding: M2001 would be coded 0, No \u2013 No issues found during review. \no  Rationale: Because the issue, in the PT\u2019s professional judgment, did not require physician (or physician- \ndesignee) contact by midnight of the next calendar day, at the latest to resolve, it does not meet the criteria \nfor a potential or actual clinically significant medication issue. \n\n2.
