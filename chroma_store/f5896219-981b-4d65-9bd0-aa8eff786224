For \nexample, prochlorperazine is dually classified as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic. Therefore, in this \nsection, it would be coded as an antipsychotic, regardless of how it is used. \n\n\u2022  Count long-acting medications, such as fluphenazine decanoate or haloperidol decanoate, that are given every \nfew weeks or monthly only if they are part of the current reconciled drug regimen at the time of assessment. \n\n\u2022 \n\nInclude newly prescribed medications that are part of the current drug regimen, even if the medication is not \nyet in the home and/or the first dose has not been taken. \n\n\u2022  A transdermal patch is designed to release medication over time (typically 3\u20135 days). \n\n\u2022  Therefore, transdermal patches would be considered long-acting medications for the purpose of coding the \n\nOASIS and are included if it is part of the patient\u2019s current drug regimen. \n\n\u2022  Combination medications should be coded in all categories/pharmacologic classes that constitute the \n\ncombination, regardless of why the medications are being used. \no  For example, Percodan is a combination medication (oxycodone and aspirin) classified as both an opioid \nand antiplatelet. Therefore, for both N0415H, Opioid and N0415I, Antiplatelet, Column 1 \u2013 Is Taking \nwould be checked, regardless of why the medication is being used.", "type": "Document"}}
