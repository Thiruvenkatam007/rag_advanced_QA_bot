Standardized assessment data elements \nare assessment items and response options that are \nharmonized across four PAC assessment instruments, \nand to which aligned standards and definitions apply. \n\n4 \n\nChapter 1 \n\nIn cases involving nursing, the RN is responsible for \ncompleting the SOC comprehensive assessment, \nincluding OASIS if applicable. For a Medicare therapy-\nonly case, the PT or SLP may conduct the SOC \ncomprehensive assessment including OASIS. Effective \nJanuary 1, 2022, OTs may conduct the SOC \ncomprehensive assessments including OASIS for \nMedicare patients when the physician\u2019s referral order \ndoes not include skilled nursing, but does include PT \nand/or SLP, along with OT. Any discipline qualified to \nperform OASIS assessments (RN, PT, SLP, OT) may \ncomplete subsequent OASIS assessments (e.g., \ntransfers, recertifications, resumptions of care, \ndischarge) after the SOC.", "type": "Document"}}
