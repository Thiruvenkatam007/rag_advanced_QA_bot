In the fall of 2003, CMS \nlaunched the Home Health Compare website.  This initiative encouraged consumers to use publicly available \nhome health quality measures when selecting a home health agency. The launch of Home Health Compare was \nalso a catalyst for agency quality improvement activities as well as the marketing and promotion of quality of care \nby individual agencies. The OASIS-based measures created the foundation for these early activities and advances \nin home health quality improvement. In 2021, CMS retired the Home Health Compare website and launched the \nCare Compare website (https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare). With Care Compare, CMS merged multiple \nsetting-specific Compare sites into one consumer-friendly site that features information from providers across the \ncontinuum. At the time of the launch of Care Compare, CMS also launched another website related to publicly \nreported data: the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) (https://data.cms.gov/provider-data). While Care Compare is a \nconsumer-focused tool, PDC is a resource geared toward providers, vendors, and researchers. The PDC website \nincludes downloadable data from the Care Compare site as well as additional measure-specific information. \n\nUNDERSTANDING QUALITY & QUALITY IMPROVEMENT", "type": "Document"}}
