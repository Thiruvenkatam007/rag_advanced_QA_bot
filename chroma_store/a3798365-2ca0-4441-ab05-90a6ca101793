The patient sustained no injury \nas a result of this fall. The second fall resulted in a laceration and bruising, considered injury, but not \nmajor injury. \n\n5.  Review of the patient record, incident reports and patient and caregiver report identify that a single fall \n\noccurred since the most recent SOC/ROC.
