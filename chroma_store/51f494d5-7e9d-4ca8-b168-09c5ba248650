Therefore, they should not be counted as medications (e.g., melatonin, chamomile, \nvalerian root) for N0415. \n\n\u2022  CMS does not specify a source for identifying the therapeutic category and/or pharmacological classification. \n\n\u2022  CMS does not provide an exhaustive list of examples for determining the source for the documented patient-\nspecific indication. Use available resources along with clinical judgment to determine if a scenario meets the \ncriteria for a patient-specific indication. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  The documentation for a patient reflects that (at SOC) they are taking edoxaban and glipizide. The \n\ndocumentation indicates the patient has type 2 diabetes and is taking the glipizide to control high blood sugar. \nThere is no indication documented for the edoxaban. \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n211\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection N: Medications \n\no  Coding: Medications in N0415 would be coded as follows: Column 1 (is taking) would be checked for E. \n\nAnticoagulant and J. Hypoglycemic. Column 2 (Indication noted) would be checked only for J. \nHypoglycemic. \n\no  Rationale: Column 2 would not be checked for E. Anticoagulant because there was no indication \n\ndocumented for the edoxaban. \n\n2.  At discharge, a patient\u2019s documentation indicates they are taking oxycodone for pain. Tramadol is also listed \n\nbut there is no indication documented for the Tramadol. \no  Coding: Medications in N0415 would be coded as follows: Column 1 (is taking) would be checked for H. \n\nOpioid. Column 2 (Indication noted) would not be checked for H. Opioid. \n\no  Rationale: Column 1, H. Opioid is checked because the patient is taking oxycodone and tramadol, both \n\nmedications within that class. However, all medications in the class need the indication to be documented \nto check Column 2. \n\nM2001: Drug Regimen Review \n\nItem Intent", "type": "Document"}}
