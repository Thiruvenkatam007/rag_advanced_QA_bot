If its use is restricted to emergencies only, report the availability as \noccasional/short-term assistance unless other caregivers\u2019 availability meets a higher level. \n\n\u2022  The caregiver(s) need not live in the home with the patient, but assistance via telephone is not included in this \n\nquestion. \n\nExamples \n\n1.
