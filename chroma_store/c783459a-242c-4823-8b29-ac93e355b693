For surgical wounds healing by primary intention, observe if the \nincision line has re-epithelialized. \n\n\u2022  Surgical wounds healing by primary intention (approximated incisions) do not granulate; therefore, the only \n\nappropriate responses are Response 0 \u2013 \u201cNewly epithelialized\u201d or Response 3 \u2013 \u201cNot healing\u201d \no  A surgical incision is not automatically coded Response 3 \u2013 \u201cNot healing\u201d solely due to the presence of \n\nstaples. \n\n\u2022  For a surgical wound healing by primary intention, if there is not full re-epithelialization, such as in the case \n\nof a scab adhering to underlying tissue, the correct response is Response 3 \u2013 \u201cNot healing\u201d \n\nEPITHELIALIZATION \nRegeneration of the epidermis across a wound surface. \n\nDEFINITION", "type": "Document"}}
