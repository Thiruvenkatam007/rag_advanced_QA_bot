For \n\nexample, \no  a fall that occurred at the doctor\u2019s office during the HH quality episode would be reported. \no  a fall that occurred during a qualifying inpatient facility transfer (e.g., hospital or SNF) would not be \n\nreported as it did not occur within a HH quality episode. \n\n\u2022  Agencies are encouraged to correct errors as accurate information regarding fall-related injuries becomes \n\nknown. For example, \n\nOASIS-E1 \nEffective 01/01/2025 \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n\n177\n\fChapter 3 \n\nSection K: Swallowing/Nutritional Status \n\no  Injuries can present themselves later than the time of the fall. \no  The agency may not learn of the level of injury until after the OASIS assessment is completed (e.g., \n\nbecause the patient was transported to ER and admitted to an inpatient facility post-fall). \n\no  Errors should be corrected following the agency\u2019s correction policy. The M0090 date would not \n\nnecessarily be changed. \n\nExamples \n\n1.  A nursing note states that a patient slipped out of their wheelchair onto the floor during a transfer from the bed \nto the wheelchair. Before being assisted back into bed, an assessment was completed that indicated no injury. \no  Coding: J1900A, No injury, would be coded 1, One, if no other falls without injury occurred.  \no  Rationale: Slipping onto the floor is a fall. No injury was noted.", "type": "Document"}}
