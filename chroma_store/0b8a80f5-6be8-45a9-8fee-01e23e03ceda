The pressure ulcer/injury can present as intact skin or an open ulcer and may be \npainful. \n\nItem Rationale \n\nAn existing pressure ulcer/injury identifies patients at risk for further complications or skin injury. \n\nTime Points Item(s) Completed \n\n\u2022  Start of Care \n\n\u2022  Resumption of Care \n\n\u2022  Follow-up \n\n\u2022  Discharge from agency \n\nResponse-Specific Instructions \n\n\u2022  The presence of pressure ulcers/injuries and unstageable pressure ulcers/injuries should be determined by \nphysical assessment and observation. Medical records, patient/caregiver report and physician input may be \nused for historical purposes only to identify the presence of an existing ulcer/injury or the stage of a \npreviously healed pressure ulcer. \n\n\u2022  Review the history of each pressure ulcer/injury in the clinical record. If the pressure ulcer/injury was \n\npreviously classified at a higher numerical stage than what is observed now, as long as it remains stageable, it \nshould continue to be classified at the higher numerical stage until healed. \n\n\u2022  Home health agencies may adopt the National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) guidelines in their \nclinical practice and documentation. However, since CMS has adapted the NPIAP guidelines for OASIS \npurposes, the definitions do not perfectly align with each stage as described by NPIAP. When discrepancies", "type": "Document"}}
